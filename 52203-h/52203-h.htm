<p class='drop-capa0_1 c004'><span class='sc'>The</span> "Comic Almanacks" of George Cruikshank have long
been regarded by admirers of this inimitable artist as
among his finest, most characteristic productions. Extending
over a period of nineteen years, from 1835 to 1853, inclusive,
they embrace the best period of his artistic career, and show the
varied excellences of his marvellous power.</p>

<p class='c000'>The late Mr. Tilt, of Fleet Street, first conceived the idea of
the "Comic Almanack," and at various times there were engaged
upon it such writers as Thackeray, Albert Smith, the Brothers
Mayhew, the late Robert Brough, Gilbert A'Beckett, and it has
been asserted, Tom Hood, the elder. Thackeray's stories of
"Stubbs' Calendar, or the Fatal Boots," which subsequently
appeared as "Stubbs' Diary;" and "Barber Cox, or the Cutting
of his Comb," formed the leading attractions in the numbers for
1839 and 1840. The Almanack was published at 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, but
in 1848-9 the size was reduced and the price altered to 1<em>s.</em>
The change did not produce the increased circulation expected,
and in 1850 it was again enlarged and published at 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> In
this year some very spiritedly designed folding plates were added,
and this feature continued until 1853, when Mr. Tilt's partner,
the late Mr. Bogue, thought proper to discontinue the work.</p>

<p class='c000'>For many years past, sets of the Almanack have been eagerly
sought after by collectors, and as much as 6<em>l.</em> and 7<em>l.</em> have
been given for good copies.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>ASS-TROLOGICAL PREDICTIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I now proceed to put on my conjuring cap, and shew forth the
wonders of the stars.</p>

<p class='c000'>On looking at the moon, through my 500-horse power telescope,
which magnifieth the planets 97,000,000 of times larger than
life, I discern, that the march of intellect hath already travelled to
that luminary; for I do distinctly perceive divers juveniles, of eighty
years old and upwards, seated on stools, with horn-books in their
hands. The Man in the Moon is also very busy, striving to metamorphose
his sticks into <em>brooms</em>, to sweep away the cobwebs of
ignorance therewith. Moreover, I do observe about half a million
miles of cast-iron rail-road, in the direction of the earth, by which
I do opine an inclination towards this planet. But there doth appear
a great consternation amongst the other constellations, more
especially in the <em>Upper House</em>, where <em>Libra</em> hath got into fiery opposition
with <em>Mars</em>; and <em>Saturn</em> (who hath grown <em>Grey</em>) hath, in
striving to part them, lost the skirts of his coat, and is glad to put
up with a <em>Spencer</em>, whereby is clearly shadowed forth a fierce encounter
between two great commanders. Let those, who think little
of law and justice, read the 10,000 volumes of the Abridgment of
the Statutes, and tremble!</p>

<p class='c000'>Touching the affairs of Europe <em>in general</em>, I can say nothing <em>in
particular</em>; excepting that I observe, that the Pope of Rome hath
been furiously dealing forth his anathemas,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> wherein he doth betray
a most marvellous lack of wit; for doth he opine, that Christian
folk are such <em>calves</em> as to be <em>cow'd</em> by a <em>bull</em>? Verily, it toucheth
me sore, to note the silly doings of the crazy old beldame, who hath
turned the world topsy-turvy for so many centuries, when she
might gather her petticoats about her, and sit down in peace and
quietness, by merely—my old friend and gossip, <em>Poor Humphrey</em>,
sagaciously observeth,—just turning <em>Protestant</em>. And, in good sooth,
when we come to think of it, there need be no quarrellings and
bickerings on religious grounds, nor scruples for conscience' sake,
in any part of the world, if all the Pagans, Hindoos, Mahometans,
Jews and folks of every religion, and of no religion at all, were
only just to make up their minds to do the same thing. And, pray,
let me ask, what can be a more simple piece of advice?</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Abbé de la Mennais has roused the thunder of the Vatican by his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paroles d'un Croyant</span></i>. The Pope has addressed an evangelical letter to the
prelates of the Catholic world, in which the Abbé is compared with John
Huss and Wickliff, and his Holiness says:—"We damn for ever this book of
small size but huge depravity."—<cite>Morning Post, June, 1834.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE GREAT COMET.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Though, touching Comets, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Halley, Sir
Isaac Newton, and others of that stamp, do deny their malign influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>on mundane affairs, yet I, <span class='sc'>Rigdum Funnidos</span>, holding in far
greater reverence the wisdom of our ancestors, and the sage opinion
of my renowned defunct predecessor, <span class='sc'>Francis Moore</span>, do maintain,
that they cast a sinister aspect on this terrestrial globe; yea, and
do mightily, in a most adverse fashion, affect the same. Where-fore,
I say, look, when the <em>Great Comet</em> cometh, for a sufficient
reason, in the coming thereof, for every thing which shall happen
contrariwise; whether it be the falling of kings, or the falling of
stocks; the quarrels of nations, or the squabbles of matrimony;
the crash of empires, or the smash of crockery; the tyranny of
despots, or the scolding of wives:—yea, I do say again, place them
all to the account of the <em>Great Comet</em>.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>Hereafter do follow sundry matters, both pleasant and profitable.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ADVERTISEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c016'>MATRIMONY.—A highly respectable Gentleman, who has,
for many years, distinguished himself as an important Public
Functionary, is desirous of <em>haltering</em> his condition, and tying the
<em>knot</em> of wedlock with a Lady of congenial sentiments. Having,
himself, a very tender disposition, he stipulates for the same on the
part of the object of his attachment; and as he is partial to <em>good
spirits</em>, he hopes she will always have a stock. She must be duly
impressed with a regard for the dignity of her husband's station,
and must never associate with her inferiors, and whatever <em>pledges</em>
she makes, she must be careful to <em>redeem</em>. The Advertiser is not
very particular as to personal attractions; and with regard to
money, he has seen so many people in a state of <em>dependence</em>, that
he merely trusts she will come provided against such an unpleasant
contingency. On these conditions, which are the <em>gaol</em> of his wishes,
he will give the fair object of his affections her <em>full swing</em>, and be
perfectly <em>resigned to his fate</em>. He anxiously looks for a <em>line</em>, addressed
"<span class='sc'>John Ketch</span>, Esq., opposite the Debtors' Door, Old
Bailey."</p>

<p class='c000'>N.B. The <em>Schoolmaster in Newgate</em>, who drew up the above advertisement,
for his respected friend, Mr. Ketch, takes this opportunity
of contradicting a report, which has been current for some
time past,—that the Schoolmaster is <em>abroad</em>, which is quite <em>foreign</em>
from the fact. Arrangements were certainly made to that effect,
which, had they been carried into execution, he would have been
quite <em>transported</em>; but he regrets to state, that he is under the necessity
of remaining at his old abode, the large stone house in the
Old Bailey.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ADVERTISEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c016'>A GENTLEMAN, who is about to proceed to New South
Wales, on the public account, for fourteen years, is desirous
of providing a confidential situation for an active YOUTH, previously
to his departure. He is exceedingly light-fingered, and very
dexterous in the conveyance of property; and, among his other
accomplishments, the advertiser can confidently recommend him
for considerable skill in opening locks without the aid of a key.
He has been brought up to the <em>bar</em>; and is <em>lineally</em> descended
from the renowned Jerry Abershaw. Most of his relations have
been raised to exalted situations, far above the ordinary crowd;
and, indeed, there is little doubt, that the force of his genius, if
suffered to take its course, will, in time, procure for him the same
degree of elevation. He can refer with confidence for a character
to any of the gentlemen composing that respectable body, the
Swell Mob Association; and the advertiser will be happy to reply
to any inquiries, addressed—<span class='sc'>Peter Prig</span>, Esq., at the Stone Jug
Hotel, Old Bailey.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><em>ABSTRACT of an ACT, intituled an Act for the Amendment of an<br /> Act for the Amendment of the Poor Laws.</em></h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>[To be passed on the 1st of April next.]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Preamble.</em>—Abuses all former Acts, and repeals them accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 1.</em>—Empowers paupers to act as Churchwardens and
Overseers; to form their own vestries, and pass laws for their own
relief.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 2.</em>—Provides for weekly tavern dinners for the same; and
stipulates for a bountiful supply of turtle-soup, venison, burgundy,
champagne, hock, claret, and rose-water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 3.</em>—Enacts that pensions, of not less than £1000 per
annum, shall be granted to all former Churchwardens and Overseers,
as a compensation for their loss of office; and that they shall
each be raised to the rank of baronet, as a compensation for their
loss of dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 4.</em>—Enacts that every able-bodied pauper, who can work,
shall be allowed five guineas per week each, and two guineas for
each of their children, illegitimate or otherwise; and should any
refractory pauper refuse this allowance, and prefer breaking stones
at a penny per bushel, he shall be forthwith committed to the
custody of the keeper of the London Tavern, if in the City of
London, or of some inn or hotel, if any other part of the kingdom,
and be compelled to feast like an alderman, till he show symptoms
of contrition.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 5.</em>—That as many paupers may prefer being boarded and
lodged, suitable mansions shall be erected for the purpose, in
cheerful and airy situations; to which governors shall be appointed,
to be elected by the paupers, for the due regulation
thereof. And if, on complaint of one or more of the said paupers,
it shall appear, that the said governor hath, on any occasion,
omitted to provide them with all due necessaries, such as silver
forks, doileys, finger-glasses, napkins, or other indispensable matters;
or hath omitted to serve their tea, coffee, or chocolate, in silver
pots, and china cups and saucers; or substituted plain lump for
double-refined lump sugar, or milk for cream, or tallow for wax
candles, or a feather-bed for a down-bed: or neglected to keep the
harp or piano in proper tune, or to furnish clean linen once a day,
(if they desire it, but not otherwise); or presumed to call them out
of bed before twelve at noon, unless specially directed so to do; or
behaved disrespectfully, or omitted to stand uncovered in their
presence, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. for each and every such offence, the said
governor shall be committed to the tread-mill for not less than six
calendar months.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><em>Clause 6.</em>—Each pauper, who is a boarder as aforesaid, shall be
at liberty to invite as many friends as he pleases, to a grand dinner
party, to be holden once a week; a concert and ball to be holden
twice a week; and a grand concert and ball to take place four
times in the year; on which occasion, the said paupers, or a committee
thereof, shall be at liberty to engage any of the Italian
singers, provided their terms do not exceed 100 guineas each per
night.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 7.</em>—Allows a premium of 50 guineas to the mother of
every illegitimate child born in the said mansion.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 8.</em>—Enacts that the halt, the maimed, and the blind,
together with all aged, infirm, diseased, idiotic, and insane persons,
and all who are unable, through mental or bodily incapacity, to
maintain themselves, shall be allowed the liberty of begging their
bread on the king's highway; by which, public sympathy will be
powerfully awakened, and pauperism effectually discouraged.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 9.</em>—Enacts that all the moneys, necessary for carrying the
foregoing provisions into effect, shall be disbursed from the pockets
of the honest and industrious.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Clause 10.</em>—Enacts that this Act shall neither be altered,
amended, nor repealed.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ADVERTISEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c016'>FOUND on a suspicious person, stopped by the Police, the
following articles, <em>viz.</em>:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The clock of old St. Dunstan's Church, with the Cross of
St. Paul's and the steeple of the church in Langham Place, which
he had converted into a seal and key, and appended thereto by a
chain cable.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The images of Gog and Magog from Guildhall. N. B. He
begged hard to have these restored to him, alleging that he had
bought them as playthings for his children.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The "collective wisdom" of St. Stephen's Chapel, which he
had purloined from the Members' skulls, before the late fire, and
had artfully concealed in a nut-shell.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The conscience of the legal profession, which, at first, was
scarcely perceptible, but on its being accidentally placed in a bag
of sovereigns, became extremely vociferous.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. A cart-load of Billingsgate abuse, and a bag of moonshine.
Should these articles not be claimed, they will be sold to the best
bidder. N.B. They would admirably answer the purpose of some
of our "best public Instructors."</p>

<p class='c000'>There were several other articles of less value, all of which will
be restored, to the right owners, on application to the Mansion
House.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>PROCEEDINGS OF LEARNED SOCIETIES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><em>At the Philosophical Institution</em>, held at the Pig and Tinder Box,
in Liquorpond Street, a letter was read by Sawney Suck-Egg,
Esq., on the possibility of extending the realms of space, and
adding to the duration of eternity. In the same essay, he also
satisfactorily proved, that two and <em>too</em> do <em>not</em> make four; that
<span class='sc'>Black</span> is very often white; and that a Chancery suit has shewn
to many a man, that what has a beginning does not necessarily
always have an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new mode of raising the wind was also communicated to this
society by Jeremy Diddler, Esq.; a very useful invention for
broken-down gamblers, ruined spendthrifts, insolvent tradesmen,
and 'Change Alley waddlers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geological Society of Hog's Norton.</em>—The fossil remains of an
antediluvian pawnbroker have been dug up, within a mile of this
place. This is not regarded as a very remarkable circumstance, as
many recent instances have been known of the hearts of several
persons of this class being in a petrified state while alive.</p>

<p class='c000'>A successful method of converting stones into bread has been
transmitted to the New Poor Law Commissioners, and a three-and-sixpenny
medal presented to the ingenious discoverer thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Zoological Society at Hookem Snivey.</em>—A new animal has been
transmitted from No-Man's Land, which has been named the Flat-Catcher.
It bears some resemblance to the human species, as it
walks on two legs, and has the gift of speech. It seems quite in
its element when among <em>pigeons</em>, and preys ravenously on the <em>gulls</em>
that hover about watering-places, getting hold of them by a kind of
fascination, which throws its unconscious victims entirely off their
guard, when it never fails to make them bleed profusely; after
which, it suffers them to depart.</p>

<p class='c000'>A laborious investigator has discovered that there are exactly
nine millions, one hundred and sixty-four thousand, five hundred
and thirty-three hairs on a tom-cat's tail, which he defies all the
zoologists in Europe to disprove. He also maintains that a bull
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>sees with its horns, and a rat with its tail, although he admits the
possibility of their doing so without them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was stated at the last meeting of this institution, that one of
its members had observed a tremendous water-spout from one of
the plugs in Thames Street; and sensible shocks of an earthquake
had been felt at Puddle-dock.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Society of Antiquaries.</em>—Among the antiquities presented at the
last meeting, was one of Cleopatra's corns, and the celebrated
Needle with which she darned her hose; also, a gas-pipe, found at
Herculaneum, and the fragment of a steam-carriage, dug out of
the ruins of Palmyra.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Entomological Society in <span class='sc'>Grub</span> Street.</em>—A very animated conversation
took place on the natural history of the flea, involving
many curious conjectures, such as, whether it had ever been known
to have attained the size of the elephant; whether it was of the
same species with the hog-in-armour and the rhinoceros, or was to
be classed among the <em>Jumpers</em>; how high and how often it leaped;
whether it always looked before it leaped; and whether it leaped
highest in Leap Year; the farther discussion of all which queries
was deferred till the said Leap Year.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Horticultural Society of Seven Dials</em> has been presented, by
the Society of Antiquaries, with the identical pumpkin converted
by the fairy into Cinderella's chariot.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Premiums have been awarded by various learned bodies to the
following</em>:—</p>

<p class='c000'>To Henry Broom, for the application of the crab motion, and the
"do-as-little-as-possible" principle, to the state engine.—To Lord
Durham, in conjunction with the above, for an improved mode of
progression for the said engine, namely, by each pulling the opposite
way.—To Signor Paganini, for an improved mode of extracting
gold from catgut scrapings, and of skinning flints.—To Miss
Harriet Martineau, for a new preventive check-string for the regulation
of the fare (<em>fair</em>).—To the proprietor of Morison's Pills for
the discovery of the <em>perpetual motion</em>.—To the Society for the Confusion
of Useful Knowledge, for their successful endeavours in be-<em>Knight</em>-ing
the public intellect.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE "WISDOM OF OUR ANCESTORS."</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Rigdum Funnidos</span> lamenteth, that there are, in this our day,
among those who do seek to subvert the venerable usages of our
ancestors, divers vauntings and boastings as to what they do most
affectedly and erroneously term "the growing intelligence of the
age,"—"the march of intellect," and such-like absurd phraseologies.
This irreverent spirit doth manifest itself in unseemly comparisons,
between the times which are past, and those which are present,
which do end in a preferring, to the wisdom of the olden time, their
own newfangled and presumptuous theories. Nay, there be even
those who do maintain, that what the lamented <span class='sc'>Francis Moore</span>
did, and other equally wise admirers of the by-gone past do, venerate
as the <em>olden</em> time, is, in very sooth, the <em>juvenile</em> time; inasmuch
as time groweth older every day, and, as a necessary consequence
thereof, every succeeding generation groweth wiser. It profiteth
not to waste words on such manifest absurdity; suffice it therefore
to say, that <span class='sc'>Rigdum Funnidos</span> hath, with much cost and travail,
assemblaged what may be most worthily intituled, a fair sample of
'<em>collective wisdom</em>' wherein will be found, most conspicuously
shown forth, the worthiness of our ancestors to the designation of
<em>Wise</em>.</p>

<p class='c020'>"Concerning the superstitious use of what is called the Glorious Hand, or
Hand of Glory, by housebreakers in their robberies, we have the following
account:—The pretended use of this glorious hand is to stupify or stun all
those who are present, and render them perfectly insensible. This glorious
hand is the hand of a hanged criminal, prepared in the following manner:—It
is wrapped up in a bit of winding-sheet, very tight, to force out the small
remainder of blood, then put into an earthen vessel with zimat, saltpetre,
salt, and long pepper, all well pulverised, after which, 'tis left fifteen days in
that pot, then taken out and exposed to the hottest sun of dog days, till it
becomes very dry; and if the sun be not hot enough, they dry it in an oven
heated with fern and vervain; then they make a sort of candle of the grease
of the hanged man, virgin wax, and Lapland sefanum, and they make use of
this glorious hand as a candlestick, to hold this candle when lighted; and in
all places wherever they come with this fatal instrument, everybody they
find there becomes immoveable. We are also told, that it is to no purpose
for thieves to make use of this glorious hand, if the threshold of the door, or
other places by which they may enter, be rubbed over with an unguent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>composed of the gall of a black cat, the fat of a white hen, and the blood of
an owl, and that this composition be made in the dog days."—<cite>Tr. of Little
Albert</cite>, p. 34.</p>

<p class='c020'>"John Weer, in his Book de Prestigus, has drawn up an inventory of the
diabolical monarchy, with the names and surnames of seventy-two princes,
and the seven million four hundred and five thousand nine hundred and
twenty-six devils, errors of computation only excepted, adding what qualities
and properties, and to what purposes they may serve when invoked."—<cite>Bodin</cite>,
p. 404.</p>

<p class='c020'>"Thrasillus, a Heathen author, cited by Stobœus, says, that at the Nile
was a stone like a bear, which cured those who were afflicted with dæmons
for as soon as ever it was applied to the noses of dæmoniacks, the devil immediately
left them."—<cite>Bodin</cite>, p. 301.</p>

<p class='c020'>"The way to be certainly loved, is, to take the marrow of a wolf's left
foot, and make of it a sort of pomatum, with ambergris and cyprus powder,
carry it about one, and cause the person to smell of it from time to time."—<cite>Albertus</cite>,

tired, and hath yet much of his journey to do, alight from him, and cut, from
the nighest hedge, a short wande, which you shall jag in notches with your
knife, and, making a hole in the thinnest of his ear, when he dothe flag
in his pace, then saw the stick to and froe in the hole, which will revive
him soe that, until he be entirely spent, he will not faile to goe.</p>

<p class='c020'><em>Another way, with the horse of</em> a friend, <em>or that is hired, and soe that the

wearied, and hath yet far to travel, get down from his back, and choose from
the road side six smooth round pebbles, of which you shall put three in his
right ear, and tye up the ear with binde-weed, or long grass, purse-wise;
then mount him again and put him on his mettle, and with the motion of his
head the stones in his ear will rattle seemingly to him like thunder, which
will soe inspirit him that while he hath life in him he will not fail to goe;
and when he doth, after that, slacken of his pace, then tye up three in his
left ear also.</p>

brass pot, and there let him die, then cut him asunder and take out the guts,

thred drying by the fire's side; when ye would use it, lay the fleshy side of

  <h3 class='c007'>THE GARDENER'S CALENDAR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>As I sat at my window a few evenings ago, a loud rattling in the
street drew my attention, and at the same instant an omnibus
stopped at my nextdoor neighbour's, the poulterer. First alighted
a servant-maid and lad—then two or three half-grown boys and
girls, intermingled with a torrent of chattels, consisting of shrubs,
flowers, enough live animals to stock a menagerie, packages past
counting, and lastly, Mrs. Giblet in full feather, arrayed in lily-white,
and bearing in each hand a full-blown balsam. All was
safely landed, when a hackney coach drove up at a quiet pace, and
from it descended, with the help of his shopmen and a pair of
crutches, my neighbour, Simon Giblet himself. His legs were
swathed up, his back, for which broadcloth was formerly too narrow,
seemed considerably shrunk, and he looked care-worn and in
pain. After him was borne his second son Dick, apparently disabled
too. I had scarcely seen my neighbour or any of his family
for some months past, but as I had often gossipped in his shop, I
determined to go down and inquire what had befallen him. He
had just arrived at his great wooden chair. His eyes were gleaming
with complacency on a goodly row of fatted fowls, all placed with
their delicate, dainty, floury broad behinds before, and as he plumped
into the seat he ejaculated, with a grunt, "Thank heaven!" A shopman
sat in a corner plucking a snow-white pullet. Giblet looked at
him wistfully, and then, "Bring it here, Sam," he cried. He took
it, plucked a few handfuls of feathers, and as he returned it to
Sam, "Thank heaven!" he grunted again. My foot kicked against
something at the threshold. I stooped and picked up a clasped
book, which I presented to him, as I tendered my sympathy. "Oh!"
said he, "nothing but disasters. I've made ducks and drakes of
my money, and a <em>goose</em> of myself; upon my <em>sole</em>, it's a blessing that
I got away before Michaelmas. I'm in too much pain to tell you
now. Ah! I see you've picked up my journal. Work or pleasure,
I've always made up a day-book every night. I'll lend it you if you
wish to see how I've been pigeoned. While I stuck to the fowls all
went fair with me, but when I took to that river-bank I was like a
duck out of water." I saw my neighbour was excited, so, after a
few consoling words, I retreated, carrying off his calendar; and
here are some extracts, by permission, for the benefit of all amateur
ruralists.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>DIARY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><em>March 21, 1834.</em>—Mrs. G. bent on a rural retirement, and declaring
this a dog-cheap bargain,—meet Mr. Grabbit to-morrow,
pay premium, and take lease of his snug place at Strand-on-the-Green.—Wife
insists on calling it Cherub Lodge, Paradise Bank.—N.B.
Original sum, £600; Grabbit seeming to like us, abates a
hundred entirely as a favour.</p>

<p class='c000'>27th.—All safe arrived: only one pier-glass split into four, and
best tea-set, bought as 32 pieces, converted into 32 dozen. However,
Mrs. G. observes, that being by the river side, we must have
a marine grotto, and the pieces of looking-glass, mixed with the
bits of blue and gold china, will make a fine glitter among the moss
and shells.</p>

<p class='c000'>28th.—Grabbit recommends Isaac Snail as head gardener, and
his son Isaac to help him—says old Isaac was his right hand, and
begged to be left in the house, he was so attached to the garden.</p>

<p class='c000'>31st.—Two days' rain, without ceasing; planning with Isaac on
the large kitchen table covered an inch thick with mould—laid down
gravel walks of red garter, and stuck up skewers for fruit trees.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>April 1.</em>—Rain falling, river rising, cellars filling.</p>

<p class='c000'>2nd.—Ducks swimming into the parlour—moved to the first floor
for safety—Musical Tom (my youngest) splashing about bare-legged
in the kitchen, and shouting "four feet water in the hold." A leak
sprung in the next onion field—all my land under water. Dick,
perched on window-sill, angling for roach in the garden. Isaac
says we shall get used to it, and the waters always go off again.
Daughter Julia tells me the people of Egypt would think it quite a
blessing—beg to differ.</p>

<p class='c000'>7th.—Can just see land.—House left rather slimy.—Isaac and I
commence gardening in earnest.—Distrained on for forty odd
pounds, taxes left unpaid by Mr. Grabbit.—To keep my goods,
parted with the money, and started to town for an explanation—found
Grabbit sailed last week for Swan River. Isaac says he was
a worthy gentleman, but had a bad memory—begin to be of the
same opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>9th.—Buried an old hen at the foot of a plum-tree by the light
of the full moon—am told it will then bear egg-plums.</p>

<p class='c000'>19th.—Potato eyes always an eye-sore, so have planted a bed
with every eye nicely cut away, by which I hope to grow a crop as
smooth as my hand and as blind as moles.—Look for the Horticultural
Society's gold medal for this bright idea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>27th.—Wondered my ranunculuses did not come up; just tried
one, found I had planted them all bottom topmost, and they were
shooting away down to what Dick says is the centre of gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>May</em> 3.—Grubbing for grubs among the rose-trees—cucumbers
in full flower—Mrs. Giblet and Julia come to help me—all busy
setting the blossoms—puzzled to tell the male flowers, till Mrs. G.
discovered it all by the book.</p>

<p class='c000'>12th.—Tulips splendid yesterday, but flagged this morning; and
after dinner all napping with their heads on the bed—Isaac said it
was the east wind. Thought there might be a grub at the roots, so
drew one up—found no bulb—all the rest the same—somebody had
taken away the roots and stuck the flowers into the ground again.</p>

<p class='c000'>13th.—Finished my new hot-water pipes for the conservatory,
all heated by the kitchen fire—a scheme of my own—Cook had a
regular flare-up with so much company yesterday, so the water was
boiling hot all day—by night the plants looked like scalded goose-berries.
This morning, all my pipes united in a <em>joint-run</em> on the
cistern, which answered their draughts to the last, and the spare
water from the green-house floor was soaking into the breakfast
parlour. The inventor just arrived—says it's all quite regular—the
cracked joints will close of themselves in time—I wonder when.</p>

<p class='c000'>23rd.—Wrote to the editor of The Gardener's Journal an account
of my plan for growing potatoes without eyes, and the experiments
for making an egg-plum tree.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>June</em> 2.—Vines cut last month, all bled to death.—Surprised that
my new potatoes without eyes have not seen daylight yet.—My
letter to the magazine in print.—Encouraging notice by editor,
"Thanks S. G. for communicating his ingenious discoveries; hopes
to hear from him again, with samples of the new potato and egg-plum."
Think I shall disclose myself, and name the new sort, the
Cherub Giblet potato. Most of the neighbours spoke to me coming
out of church yesterday, but little thought who S. G. was.</p>

<p class='c000'>12th.—Suppose I want exercise.—Wife blows me up, and says I
get puffy; so, to keep all smooth with her and the garden walks,
drag the great roller about for two hours, morning and night.</p>

<p class='c000'>19th.—Insects in green-house devouring all my new plants;
searched book for a remedy, and last night popped in a pan of
burning brimstone. This morning all the grubs shrivelled to shreds,
and every plant dead and stripped as naked as a plucked chicken.
Tom begs to have the green-house to keep his pigeons in.</p>

<p class='c000'>23rd.—Fill up odd time in watching fruit trees with a rattle, for
the birds perch on the sham cats and build nests in the mawkins.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>What with opening and shutting the cucumber-frames, according
to the sun, wind, and clouds, plenty to do.—Charged the garden-engine
with lime water—set Dick and Tom to play upon the caterpillars.
They have so whitewashed the three Miss Blackets, that
I have two velvet bonnets, a silk pelisse, and a cashmere shawl to
pay for.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>July</em> 3.—Tool-house robbed last night; all cleared out but the
garden roller. Isaac's list for a new outfit—spades, forks, dibbers,
trowels, traces, hoes, rakes, weeders, scrapers, knives, pruners, axes,
saws, shears, scythes, hammers, pincers, lines, levels, sieves, watering-pots,
syringes,—he would have gone on, but I stopped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>9th.—Set nooses for wild rabbits, which are devouring everything
green, even the bays. This morning found we had strangled
Dick's lop-eared doe. Tom, who is learning to joke, observed that
she had wandered for a change of food, and had found a <em>halter</em>-ation.</p>

<p class='c000'>18th.—The Cherub Giblet potatoes not coming up to time, tried
the ground and found them rotting—all gone off without a single
shoot.—Mem. To forget them in my next to The Gardener's Journal.</p>

<p class='c000'>24th.—Half my time taken up in driving the butterflies off the
gooseberry trees. Left my weeding-gloves stuck on a stick last night—put
them on this morning, and smashed five slugs in one, and
seven earwigs in the other.—Mem. Old gloves the best slug-trap.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>August</em> 5.—My cucumber frames yield plenty of fruit—have
gathered not less than twenty, worth twopence each—cost me only
five pounds six shillings and sevenpence.</p>

<p class='c000'>9th.—Strolled into shrubbery this evening with a lanthorn, for
the pleasure of viewing things in a new light—up started two figures
from among the bushes, tumbled me, lanthorn, and all, into a bed
of roses, and escaped. Mem. 'Stablish a spring gun to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>15th.—Wall-fruit ripening—must have a few friends while there
is something for them—fresh-gathered peaches always a treat.</p>

<p class='c000'>19th.—Up at six to look after the fruit—all hope of a dessert
had deserted my walls—every ripe plum, peach and nectarine, clean
gone, as though the rogues knew that I had asked ten to dinner.
Said nothing, but sent off Isaac to Covent Garden. Obliged to do
it liberally, having unfortunately been boasting. Looked in book
for best man-trap—found it called the humane, because it only
breaks the leg. Mem. Set up a man-trap to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>25th.—My egg-plums ripe at last—sent off a loaded branch to
my correspondent the editor—Letter of thanks in return, saying
that my tree would have produced egg-plums whether I had buried
the old hen or not.—Envious, no doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><em>September</em> 2.—Terrible outcry in the garden, this morning, before
I was up—ran down in my shirt—unlucky Dick had stolen a march
on the egg-plum tree for a private regale. Branch broke—there he
was on his back, kicking—hives upset—could not see Dick for bees—got
help and rescued him at last—all stung a little—Dick poulticed
from head to foot, and laid up for a month at least. Isaac
says it is a thousand pities, as the honey was almost ready for
taking.</p>

<p class='c000'>18th.—Went to the Bank to-day—lot of garden tools at old iron-shop
in the City Road—very cheap and ready marked S. G., so
bought and despatched them home—looked up, and saw "Jacob
Snail" over door—thought it rather suspicious.</p>

<p class='c000'>19th.—Could not sleep for thinking of Isaac and the tools—bright
moonlight at two—looked through the window—something moving
on the garden wall—saw two men among the bees—seized my
musket—called Harry to follow me—crept down through the shrubs,
and there was old Isaac, plain enough, tying the hives in sacks and
handing them to young Isaac on the wall—made sure of the old
fox, so fired at the young one; down he fell into the ditch outside.
Sprung forward, forgetting the spring gun, caught the wire and all
the shot in my legs—never made such a jump in my life—took me
plump, head and shoulders, into the man-trap. There I was locked
fast across the chest. How I blessed myself that it was a humane
man-trap!—Old Isaac escaped.—Here I am in bed and likely to be
lame for life—plenty of time for reflection—begin to think myself
an ass.</p>

<p class='c000'>23rd.—Old Isaac not to be found—tracked the young fox—brought
him to confession—both been plundering me every night
from the beginning. Old Isaac stole my tools, and his brother sold
them to me again. Young Isaac stole my tulips—together they
stole my peaches and nectarines the night before my party, and the
old knave, when I sent him to town for more, fetched my own from
his cottage, and charged me with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>25th.—A notice to-day, by which I learn that I have been imposed
on by a swindling knave who had no right to sell me the place
or take a premium—that the owner is coming from the continent
and wants instant possession—never so thankful in my life—better
already—pack up—send for van—hire omnibus for wife, children,
and light luggage—go gently myself with poor Dick in a coach.</p>

<p class='c000'>26th.—Here comes the omnibus. Huzza!</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c016'>BRUTISH HUMBUG COLLEGE OF HEALTH.—The
wonderful efficacy of the <span class='sc'>Morising Pills</span> becomes every day
more perspicuous. The discerning Public swallows 'em 'like winking;'
and we defies all opposition, and the <em>Weakly</em> attempts of our
enemies to <em>Dispatch</em> us. We tells those as calls us quacks, that,
under the blessing of Divine Providence, we glories in our ignorance;
and takes every opportunity of exposing it, for the benefit
of our suffering fellow-creatures. And we have found them a
<em>sovereign</em> remedy for ourselves; having, for a long while, been
afflicted with an emptiness of the chest, and a great deficiency of
the <em>yellow-stuff</em>, all which terrible symptoms have speedily disappeared;
so we feels in duty bound to propagate our pills to the
remotest prosperity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following are selected out of several millions of cases,
furnished by a single agent, in a most sensible letter, to prove
the never-to-be-enough-wondered-at wonderful efficacy of the
Hy-gee-wo-ian Medicines.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Being clearly convinced, from a proper use of my reasoning
faculties, that it is perfectly consistent with probability and good sense to
believe that one medicine, made of I don't know what, by I don't know
who, is certain to cure every disorder, and is equally efficacious in all ages
and constitutions, from the infant of a week old, to the old man of eighty;
and being, moreover, equally well convinced that it is quite unreasonable to
place any sort of trust or dependence on the prescriptions of men of scientific
education, who have merely devoted their whole lives to the medical profession;—and,
further, being struck with the astounding fact, and exceeding
likelihood, that an universal panacea could only be reserved for those who
are quite innocent of all medical knowledge, and whose perfect disinterestedness
is manifested by their being contented with the trifling remuneration
derived from the credulity of the British public;—I say, Sir, for all these
reasons I have become a zealous advocate of the Hy-gee-wo-ian medicines.</p>

<p class='c020'>Having been appointed your agent, and, therefore, influenced, like yourself,
by the most disinterested motives, I make it a point to recommend them
on all occasions, and always in sufficiently large doses, on which I observe
you lay peculiar stress; and very justly: for does it not follow, as a matter
of course, that if six pills do a certain quantity of good, six thousand must,
as a natural consequence, do six thousand times as much more good, and the
patient must be six thousand times the better for them? There are some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>censorious folks who insinuate that the more pills I sell the more money I
get by them; but I need not assure you that, in this respect, my motives
are quite as disinterested as your own.</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'>A most respectable friend of mine, at the suggestion of a worthy
magistrate of Surrey, felt himself constrained to take steps for his improvement
at that celebrated place of fashionable resort, Brixton Tread Mill.</p>

<p class='c020'>For a considerable period he was greatly delighted with this elegant
mode of recreation; and was much struck with the ingenuity of an invention
by which a person might walk fifty or sixty miles a day, without the inconvenience
of changing the scene. But, somehow or other, being a man of
very ardent temperament, he entered so much into the spirit of the amusement
that—but I scarcely know how to describe it, lest I should be suspected
of exaggeration, a fault I hold in the greatest abhorrence—in short,
we have all of us heard of pedestrians, after a hard day's travel, complain of
having nearly walked their feet off; but my unfortunate friend literally did
so; and so intent was he on his salubrious pastime that he kept walking on
upon his bare stumps; nor would it have been discovered, had not his feet,
on finding that they had no longer the power of motion, determined that
nothing else should have that power; and spitefully stopped the mill, by
getting entangled in the machinery.</p>

<p class='c020'>The kind-hearted governor, who witnessed the occurrence, told my friend
not to mind such a trifle, but to <em>morris on</em>. This happy expression brought
to his mind your justly famous <em>Morrissing Pills</em>; and being naturally desrious
of recovering his footing, a messenger was <em>morrissed off</em> for a supply.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>At the first dose, he only swallowed a dozen boxes, which had no very visible
effect; a thing not to be wondered at; because, as you justly observe in your
advertisements, it is impossible to take too many. The following night,
however, he trebled the quantity; and, next morning, being awakened by
what seemed the shooting of his corns, he put his hand down, and found a
pair of full-grown handsome feet, more than twice as big as his old ones.
I should observe, there was one trifling deviation,—the heels were foremost;
and, on getting out of bed, and attempting to walk towards the mill, he
found an invariable tendency to proceed in an opposite direction. On the
circumstance being observed by the governor, he very kindly told him not to
afflict himself on that head, as he found all his pupils at first had a similar
propensity; but, by a strict attention to a bread-and-water regimen, and a
small quantity of blood being drawn from the back by one of his amiable
assistants, they soon so far recovered, that the mere presence of himself, or
one of his assistants, was quite sufficient to prevent a relapse. My friend
suggested that a dose, or even the promise of a dose, of the <em>Morrissing Pills</em>
would be much more certain to prove efficacious; and the governor very
politely promised to give them a trial, as he confessed, he said, that the operation
of bleeding was particularly painful to his tender feelings.</p>

<p class='c020'>As to the inconvenience of the matter in the ordinary business of life, my
respected friend seems to think that it can make but little difference, as he
has always gone backward all his life-time; indeed, it is a question with
him whether it is not an advantage; as, instead of mixing in mobs and
frays, as he was very much in the habit of doing, his feet will now carry him
in a clean contrary direction, quite out of harm's way.</p>

Medicine, he was able to walk home, and eat a hearty dinner of bacon and

<p class='c020'><em>P.S.</em>—I forgot to add, that the poor woman, in the hurry of the moment,
made a small mistake, by placing the head of a donkey, which had been
blown off by the explosion, upon her husband's shoulders, instead of his own;
but she says it is of very little consequence, as very few of his acquaintance
could perceive any difference.</p>

      <div class='line'>She never utters vulgar words, but talks just like nobility.</div>
      <div class='line'>I met her at Vauxhall, last year, and she gave me a sad relation</div>
      <div class='line'>About Miss Briggs: I recollect it every word;—but here's her own narration:</div>
      <div class='line'>"Oh, dear! my dear Miss Popkins! have you heard what befel Miss B.?</div>
      <div class='line'>(I wish, Papa, you'd get <em>up to snuff</em> the lights; one can hardly see:</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, la! you've made 'em <em>flare up so</em>, I declare we are quite in a blaze:</div>
      <div class='line'>And, bless me! there's all the people staring at us, all in amaze!)</div>
      <div class='line'>I'll tell you, while Papa is taking his <em>punch</em>; <em>his pipkin</em> he calls the bowl,</div>
      <div class='line'>(You <em>make yourself scarce</em> any punch at home, Papa; so I suppose you'll drink the whole).</div>
      <div class='line'>I'm sure he will, Miss P.; and even then he wont have quench'd his drouth.</div>
      <div class='line'>(I really wonder, Pa', how you can pour so much punch <em>down in the mouth</em>.)</div>
      <div class='line'>But how I rattle on! quite forgetting all about Miss B.</div>
      <div class='line'>You must know we were on a visit at a country cousin's; and after tea</div>
      <div class='line'>We stroll'd about with Mr. Timbs, and Mr. Figgins, and Mr. Oddy;—</div>
      <div class='line'>I declare <em>there he goes with his eye out</em>-staring every body.</div>
      <div class='line'>Poor fellow! he has but one, for the other's made of glass;</div>
      <div class='line'>'Twas a sad accident; and I'll tell you how it came to pass:—</div>
      <div class='line'>One night, he went out rabbit-<em>shooting</em>; <em>the moon</em> was shining bright;</div>
      <div class='line'>His gun was overloaded and bursted; and so one eye lost its sight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Well, Miss Briggs is a very bold girl; as bold a girl as one knows;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as we were walking along, the laundress caught <em>my eye; and</em></div>
      <div class='line'>'<em>Betty Martin</em>,' says Miss B., '<em>where do you hang out</em> your clothes?'</div>
      <div class='line'>She came to a well after that; and, really, I am almost ashamed to tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, upon my word, she behav'd exceedingly ill about that well.</div>
      <div class='line'>She began to <em>kick the bucket</em>; and to a man who was chopping down a tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>She said: 'What are you with that <em>axe about</em>?' which was very rude indeed of Miss B.;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he left off chopping, she said, 'Why don't you <em>cut your stick</em>?'</div>
      <div class='line'>The man was just then chopping a piece of wood that was thick.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now this made him quite confus'd; and in his hurry his skill to show off,</div>
      <div class='line'>He made a slip with his axe, and chopped poor Miss Brigg's little toe off.</div>
      <div class='line'>The shock gave me such a terrible pain all over <em>my eyes and limbs</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I really should have fainted, if it hadn't been for that dear Mr. Timbs.</div>
      <div class='line'>Poor Frederick Figgins was so affected that I vow he began to cry;</div>
      <div class='line'>I'm sure he did, for I was close to him, and I saw a <em>drop in his eye</em>.</div>
      <div class='line'>He's a <em>nice young man</em>; and <em>I shouldn't wonder</em> if he soon married Miss Briggs:</div>
      <div class='line'>Her father is a coarsish man, and says he shall, <em>please the pigs</em>.</div>
      <div class='line'>He wasn't very gracious, tho', at first, to Mr. Figgins;</div>
      <div class='line'>For when he ask'd his consent, he said to him (I had the whole story from Mr. Higgins)</div>
      <div class='line'>'<em>How are you off? for soap</em> and candles, and such-like, got me all my money;</div>
      <div class='line'>And for my daughter to marry a poor man wouldn't be vastly funny.</div>
      <div class='line'><em>How's your mother</em> left you; or have you your fortune to get?</div>
      <div class='line'>If you have <em>I wish you may get it</em> soon; but I can't let you marry Miss Bet;</div>
      <div class='line'>But while I'm describing his bluntness, I'm wand'ring away from my point.</div>
      <div class='line'>The limbs of my relation are indeed terribly out of joint.</div>
      <div class='line'>Well, Mr. Figgins help'd Miss B. home to <em>hop</em>: <em>the twig</em>, which happen'd to lay across her foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sav'd her other toes, to be sure, but there was a terrible large gash in her boot.</div>
      <div class='line'>But poor Mr. F.! how he <em>fretted</em>! <em>his fat</em> cheeks than a mummy's were thinner;</div>
      <div class='line'>He never could eat any breakfast, and seldom could eat any dinner.</div>
      <div class='line'>His eyes were once bright as a <em>star</em>: <em>the glaze</em> on them now was quite ghostly;</div>
      <div class='line'>A cloud seem'd to <em>darken his day</em>—<em>light</em>some and gay he'd been mostly.</div>
      <div class='line'>A party he join'd at Vauxhall; but its gaieties fail'd to delight him:</div>
      <div class='line'>He did nothing but swallow rack-punch; as to eating, 'twas vain to invite him.</div>
      <div class='line'>He call'd to his friend: '<em>Jemmy Johnson, squeeze me</em> a lemon;' and turning to me then,</div>
      <div class='line'>He said, in a voice that quite shock'd me, and looking as wild as a heathen:</div>
      <div class='line'>'My spirits I cannot <em>keep up; your pluck</em>'d flowers droop slower than I do;</div>
      <div class='line'>I'm sure that I make <em>no mistake</em>,—my fate will be that of poor Dido.'</div>
      <div class='line'>(I declare I am talking pentameters; quite forgetting you're not a Blue Stocking;</div>
      <div class='line'>But that I am sure you'll excuse.)—Well, isn't the story quite shocking?</div>
      <div class='line'>Miss Briggs, tho', got quite well at last; to the dolefuls he bade adieu quickly;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet a long while he talk'd of her death, though he no longer look'd mournful and sickly.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>'<em>All round my hat</em>, while I liv'd,' he said, 'a crape hatband I should have worn,—</div>
      <div class='line'><em>A shocking bad hat</em>, to be sure; but just fit for a lover forlorn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Think what would have been my despair, with no consolation to go to!</div>
      <div class='line'>But tho' I have not lost her quite, yet, alas! I have lost her in <em>toe-toe</em>.'"</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>Paragraphs Extraordinary.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>[<span class='sc'>Advertisement.</span>]—We never admit puffs into our paper in any disguise
or under any circumstances, for we are sure that "the man who would
make" <em>a puff</em> "would pick a pocket." It is a love for veracity alone that
induces us to state, that <span class='sc'>Monsieur Charlatan's</span> TUSKOLATUM MYSTIFICATUM
for renewing decayed TEETH is the most wonderful and
surprisingly efficacious invention ever invented. How will those ancient
maidens rejoice, who have only a colt's tooth in their heads, when they are
told, that by sowing this panacea in their gums overnight, a fine crop of
full-grown grinders will sprout up by the following morning! We speak
from our own experience; and whereas, before we used this extraordinary
invention, our great anxiety was how to get teeth for our food, the only
matter that now troubles us is how to get food for our teeth.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Accidents.</span>—We are happy to state that there is a great diminution in
the number of accidents in the past week. Only 250 persons have been
drowned by steam-boats; 320 women and children burnt to death by their
clothes catching fire; 560 run over by omnibusses and cabs; 252 poisoned
by taking oxalic acid instead of salts; 360 scalded to death by the bursting
of steam-boilers; 200 blown to atoms by the explosion of powder-mills; and
about 100—there or thereabouts—stabbed by drunken soldiers, off duty; all
which evinces a great increase of vigilance, carefulness, and humanity,
highly creditable to all parties concerned.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c000'>I DO herewith, present thee with an hieroglyphic, after the
accustomed usage of my lamented precursor and prototype,
<span class='sc'>Francis Moore</span>, defunct. It prefigureth a mighty change now lying
in the womb of futurity, and which doubtless will be brought forth
in due season by the great man-midwife, Time.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>And now do I most entreatingly invite thee to cast a Parthian
glance at my foregone prophetic lucubrations, and especially towards
that symbolical prefiguration or <em>hieroglyphic</em>, by which I brightly
shadowed forth <em>a certain notable event</em>, the fulfilment whereof did
so closely follow the heels of the prediction as to cause the multitude
to marvel;—and when thou hast sufficiently pondered thereupon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>I would ask thee whether thou dost not in verity deem me a fit and
worthy successor of the renowned <span class='sc'>Francis Moore</span>, defunct?</p>

<p class='c000'>I do thus throw myself on thy candour, because certain of mine
adversaries do most unworthily insinuate, that my astrological
skill is stark naught; that I hold no correspondence with the stars;
that I am no more acquainted with the Great Bear than with the
Great Mogul; that I gather no signs of the Times from the signs
of the Zodiac; and, in brief, that I am <em>no conjuror</em>! My only
familiar, they affirm, is a little, insignificant, diminutive thing, called
<em>Common Sense</em>, whose aid any one may have if he chooses; that
the said <em>Common Sense</em> collects together certain things called <em>Past
Events</em>, with which he compares <em>Present Appearances</em>, and they help
him to <em>Future Probabilities</em>; they are then put into the crucible of
<em>Ordinary Judgment</em>; and my sagacious and veracious prophecies
and hieroglyphics are the result of this simple alchemy!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Candid Reader!</span> Let thine own discretion decide, whether
logical judgment or astro-logical fudgement be the art which
influenceth my lucubrations.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Extraordinary Circumstance.</span>—Yesterday, a shabbily-dressed, half-genteel,
poetical-looking sort of man, suddenly fell down in one of the gin-palaces
in St. Giles's; after having, as it was supposed, put an end to his
existence, by swallowing a quartern of <em>Deady's</em> Best. On taking him,
however, to the Station House, and administering large doses of cold water
(to which his stomach manifested a particular antipathy by repeatedly
serving it with an ejectment), he was sufficiently recovered to give some
account of himself; but the following lines, written on the back of a dirty
tobacco paper, found in his pocket, will sufficiently explain the cause of the
rash act. It will be seen that he was a man of <em>letters</em>, tho' (judging from his
reservedness) of very few <em>words</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roaming along, the other day, in those regions of Cockney retirement,
the vicinity of the Cat and Mutton Fields, about a mile from
the <em>Ultima Thule</em> of Shoreditch, I was struck by the appearance of
a row of neat little houses; and my attention was so particularly
arrested by one of them, that I incontinently paused to look at it.
It seemed to have all the ostentatious assumption of a little man
who strives to look big. It had a portico, that might have belonged
to the Colosseum, with a flight of stone steps that would have graced
the new palace at Pimlico; and the drawing-room windows were
ambitiously overshadowed by a verandah, not unworthy of Worthing.</p>

<p class='c000'>While I was meditating on its appearance, and admiring the
extraordinary air of cleanliness which distinguished it from its
neighbours, a paper parcel, tied round with thread, and sealed with
a thimble, fell at my feet. I looked above and around me, but no
one was visible; and conceiving it to be intended for myself, I picked
it up, and walked on. At a favourable opportunity I opened it, and
read as follows:—</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>"This cums Hopping that sum boddy in the Street Walking
may pick me up and put me into the Square box at the Circling
librey, the Place where the Post is. It is the haughty bioggrify of
a unfortnit yung cretur who's in servis. Let the supperscripshun
be to the Mournin Herald or the Currier or the Trew Son or the
Stand Hard, or the Spekt Tatur, or any of 'em, for one's just as
good as tother. I think the noospapers would take it inn, for they
takes in a good many servants as wants places.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My pappa was a Baker, and he meant I shuld be Bread up like
a lady, for tho I was the least of the Batch, i was the Flour of the
flock. But pappa Dying, i had to git my Living, for he didn't Roll
in ritches, and his guds and chappels were Saddled with detts, witch
Spurred me on to Bridel my greef, tho i seldom had a Bit in my
mouth, wich was hard; and when our Blow got Wind, i lost my
sweethart, wich Blow was Harder. He was sitch a nice yung man;
and when i walkt past his Door, he used to prays my Gate, and tell
me when we were marryd we should live in Stile. But I am Loth
to say, he turned out a Willing, and wanted te tak advantidge of
my citywashun. But I had 2 strings to my Beau in a yung mit-chipman,
but he got prest and sent on board a Tender, witch was
a grate Hard Shipp for him, and I felt it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But to cut a Long Tail Short,—when my dear Ben Bannister
left me, miss fortin Staired me in the face, and every boddy turn'd
their Backs on me, and I culd not bare such a Front, so i got a
place as a servnt of all work, and my mind was maid up to be in
duster house: but it was a Grate fall for me down into the Kitchen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>tho when i got there i found a Grater; for my first missus was a
Dresser, and often and often when I've bin all over greece she has
calld me up to her Rome to help her on with her gownd, witch was
very humblin to 1 as was used to have her own made to wait upon
her. Butt i left her bekause we lived at a Fishmongers &amp; itt Smelt
so; and i had more than twenty Plaices in the first 12 months, wich
Maid me quite Crabby, for I was going Backwards. But mississes
are as proud as my lord Mare, and makes you work like an Horse;
so I turned myself Out, for i culd not In-Door itt.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wont trubbel you with all my trubbels, but will skipp over
the hole to give you my Last, wich dont Fit me at all; and its Jest
no Joke, I can ashure you, for its like as if my 20 mississes was
turnd into one. I've bin in the plaice almost a month, soe I have
had a pritty gud experense.</p>

<p class='c000'>"First, i Seconds all the close, &amp; theres 13 of us in fammaly.
Theres missis &amp; master, thats 2, but misses says as how theyre 1:
theres the 3 young ladys is 5; and the 3 boys from skool, where i
am sure they never larnt no manners, &amp; I dont love em at all, that's
Hate; &amp; the 2 yung babbys in harms is 10; and mr. Phipps the
frunt parler loger is 11, and mr Snooks the back parler loger is 12
&amp; i am just thirteen. So i leaves you to juge when i Hang em all
out if there isnt enuff to Do for.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Missis is what they calls a not Abel womman, &amp; keeps 1
scrubbin &amp; doin all day long, &amp; is so pertickler, that when master
cums home on a wet day, i has to lift him into the hous for fear he
shuld dirty the steps. To be shure he's a werry littel man, but
then its so shockin indillikat. Missis is verry fond of Bruin too,
witch i cant Bear, and i hates Hops, xcept when i goes to a dance;
besides, the Hopperation quite puts one into a fomentation, and
sets one all of a Work. Then the fammaly is so verry unreglar, &amp;
we keeps a deal of cumpany, tho they dont alow any follerers, and
missis is always snubbin me if the Butcher or the Baker stopps a
minuet att the gait. But if i were even to liv in a garratt, i shuld
be abuv sitch peepel &amp; shuld look down uppon em. I no one of the
yung ladys casts a sheeps eye on the Butcher herself, but i hop he
wont giv her his Hart, for i am shure she would be a gay Liver, &amp;
i no she has plenty of Tung.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wile i am uppon theas yung ladys i culd pick a hole in em, but
i abhor Back bitin. Howsomdever, tho they are Twins all Three
of em, theres no Unity in One of em, and when a gentilman is
interdeuced to the fammaly, they all fall in luv with him, wich
must be verry embrasing to the party, and they try all their harts
of captywashun. Miss Carryline rites a billy dux anomilously and
folds it like a trew lovyers not, to puzzel him. Miss Matilda makes
annoys on the harp with her bigg Fistis, and says she had her
lessons from a Boxer; and miss Jimmima thumps away on the
piney Forty, Fifty times a day, to git pirfict for the heavening. I
often wishes thare was locks to them keys.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But all their Harts wont do, &amp; theyve none of them got a Deer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>yet, for they make themselves 2 Chepe, &amp; they are all of em verry
jellus of me, bekause the 2 gentilmen logers has a grate licking for
me; &amp; they carrys their spit so Fur that I mustnt ware a Bore,
and they sets their mama Hat me if they sees a bit of lace on my
Cap. They makes quite a Furze too if i incloses my Waste with a
ribbon tho its so Common; &amp; I'm shure they had better pay what
they Hose than find fault with my Stockins; for they stands over
me while i am Pinking em, witch shose they aint well Red in their
manors, and they wont lett me Ware em no Ware. I shuld lik to
no why servnts aint to doo what they likes with their hone; for
Ive red theyve as big a steak in the common unity as their Betters,
who're many of em nothin else but Gamblers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But i dont mind the Hitts of sich Misses: for its all Shear envy,
becaus they wants to Cut me out with the 2 logers, &amp; had rayther
see me Hangd than Halter my condishun. But the gentilmen
dont lik none of em, for theyre as tall and as pail as 2 hapenny
Rushlites and a grate deal more Wicked. Mr. Snooks, the loger as
walks the Horsepittels in the back parler, says theyre more like
ottomies than wimmen, for they've none of em got no hannimashun;
and mr. Phipps the clark as hokkipies the frunt parler says theyre
quite Ciphers to me, for i am a better Figger, &amp; more uprighter
than any 1 of em. He sometimes carrys his devours to such a
Pitch, that if i culd forgit my Tar, I see no resin why i shuld not
marry him, &amp; then the miss Rushlites would be very much Put Out
when they'd lost one of their Flames.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mr. Phipps is a littery man, and nose a Grate many Tongs,
and has maid a bigg book of Pottery, full of Plates. He tells me
not to be jellus because he Courts the Mews, &amp; has sent me the
histry of his life &amp; a coppy of verses on my mississes yousidge of
me; and i hop you'll tell the noospaper man he mustnt take my
life without takin his'n &amp; he may have the pottery into the bargain.</p>

      <div class='line'>Through frost and snow, how I went so far,</div>
      <div class='line'>To stare in vain at the polar star,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how I sought by night and noon</div>
      <div class='line'>To bag the beams of the arctic moon;</div>

      <div class='line'>With sneers at the "Useful Knowledge" sages;</div>
      <div class='line'>And about the land of the Esquimaux,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where I gave a squeeze to many a squaw;</div>
      <div class='line'>But sighed to think that a time must come</div>
      <div class='line'>To clear them off by "the force of Rum;"</div>
      <div class='line'>And how I came to an island blest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which foot of man had never press'd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grateful to the Spinning <em>Gin</em>-ny,</div>
      <div class='line'>That lined my purse with many a guinea,</div>

      <div class='line'>One night I saw a vision fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of knighthood's honours in the air;</div>
      <div class='line'>And how, agog to reach my glory,</div>
      <div class='line'>I hasten'd home to print my story;</div>
      <div class='line'>And how I thought 'twould have been no blame</div>
      <div class='line'>To have left behind the halt and lame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dead weights that, everybody knows,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are only fit to feed the crows?</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>ANNUAL REGISTER<br /> OF<br /> REMARKABLE OCCURRENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jan.</span> 13th.—<em>Three</em> young men on the Serpentine cutting a figure of <em>six</em>, about
<em>nine</em> in the morning of <em>twelfth</em> day, were <em>two</em> careless, though warned be-<em>four</em>, to
<em>weight</em> the reading of the Society's "not-ice," so popped into <em>sixteen</em> feet water.
They were speedily helped out of the ice-<em>well</em>, and resolved to <em>cut</em> away and not
<em>come again</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>21st.—An Omnibus Cad was brought before the Lord Mayor, charged with
having been guilty of civility to a passenger, by neglecting to bang the door against
his <em>stern</em>, in time to throw him on his <em>head</em>. His Lordship said such conduct was
unprecedented; but as the man, in extenuation, proved that he had cried "go
<em>on</em>," while another gentleman was getting <em>off</em>, he thought the case did not call for
interference. The culprit, however, was dismissed by the Paddington committee,
lest his example should contaminate the others.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Feb.</span> 4th.—The following horrible event occurred in a family lately arrived
from India. A female of colour, one of the establishment, was sitting by the fire,
with two of her dark little progeny by her side, when a black footman, remarkable
for his savage disposition, suddenly entered the room, seized one of them in
each hand, hurried to the water cistern, and plunging in the struggling little ones,
held them till life was extinct. In vain the distracted mother implored compassion;
the bystanders seemed to think there was no law against drowning
kittens.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>March</span> 12th.—An elderly gentleman, crossing Fleet Street, was driven <em>through</em>
by the <em>Perseverance</em> Omnibus. He was carried into the nearest shop, and, after
taking six boxes of Morison's pills, felt so little inconvenience that he expressed
his determination to keep the orifice open, so as not to be an obstruction to carriages
in future.</p>

<p class='c000'>8th.—On Thursday, died Old Tom, the Leadenhall Market Gander, after having
worthily supported the city dignity for thirty years. The Court of Aldermen
attended his funeral, and his deeds were not forgotten by the City Remembrancer.
His spirit still haunts the old spot, and nightly takes in his favourite stuffing of
sage and onions, and the poulterers say they always know <em>the ghost</em> when they see
him <em>a-gobblin</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>26th.—Mr. Morison was elected principal of Brazen-nose College on presenting
to its library a copy of his treatise on <em>Assurance</em>, with tables of the average termination
of life, as deduced from the last returns of the <em>pills</em> of mortality.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>April</span> 1st.—According to annual custom, a considerable number of persons
assembled this morning on Tower Hill to see the Lions washed. It was, however,
officially notified that, the menagerie having been broken up, they could not be
gratified, but that his Majesty, in order to prevent their entire disappointment,
would, for this occasion, substitute the shaving of a Donkey; with a recommendation
that each individual do perform the ceremony at his own home in future.</p>

<p class='c000'>14th.—The Hackney Coaches of the Metropolis met at their usual resting time,
which lasts from sixty minutes past twelve on Saturday night till sixty minutes
before one on Sunday morning, and resolved to petition Parliament in favour of
Sir Andrew's Sunday Bill. They complained that though on that day they always
had more <em>fare</em>, they had no more food, for though they were never without the
taste of <em>a bit</em>, they had no leisure to bite; and that though the weather might be
ever so fine, for them it was always <em>rein</em>-y. They, however, did not wish to make
exorbitant demands, and would be quite satisfied if Sunday, to others a day of
joy, might be to them a day of "<em>Wo</em>." Earl <em>Grey</em> was asked to present the petition,
and signified "yea" by saying "neigh."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><span class='sc'>May</span> 5th.—The attention of the passengers in Salisbury Square was excited by
observing an inhabitant come out at the attic window of a house (No. 66), and pass
along the parapet. His next neighbour, with whom he was known to be on bad
terms, soon after appeared on the adjacent roof. They approached each other
with signs of anger, and grappling, engaged in a furious struggle;—both fell from
the parapet;—fortunately escaping the iron spikes below, and alighting on their
feet, each spit at the other, cried "moll-row," and rushed down his own area.</p>

<p class='c000'>15th.—As Doctor Fillpot was walking in the Zoological Gardens, his Christian
charity was blown into the cage of the Humming birds, and instantly pecked up
by the voracious little animals, who, strange to say, did not seem at all inconvenienced
by the extraordinary meal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>June</span> 3rd.—A nursemaid and three fine children were lost in some cart ruts,
called "The New Promenade," in Regent's Park, and have never been heard of
since.</p>

<p class='c000'>9th.—At the Annual Meeting of the Proprietors of the Thames Tunnel, the
secretary reported that though the <em>Leeks</em> had all ceased, he was happy to say there
was no diminution of <em>Salaries</em>; that they had got <em>over</em> all the soft <em>mud</em>, which
was hard; but they had now to get <em>under</em> a hard <em>rock</em>, which was harder; that
their money in the <em>stocks</em> was expended in digging <em>stones</em>; and that they had not
reached the opposite <em>Bank</em>, though they had exhausted their <em>Banker</em>; and that, in
all probability, though they might labour to the end, they would never see the
end of their labour; for however <em>light</em> they might make of it, they were more in the
<em>dark</em> than ever. The meeting, in great discontent, divided without a dividend;
and, grunting like <em>hogs</em>, pronounced the w<em>hole</em> a great <em>bore</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>July</span> 5th.—The old and young elephants, from the Zoological Gardens, were
brought up at Marylebone office. It appears that during the night they had made
their way to the Paddington Canal <em>Bank</em>, had broken open the <em>Locks</em>, and
abstracted all the water, with which they got beastly "drunk on the premises."
Their return home in that state caused suspicion to fall on them, and their apartments
being searched, the stolen property was found concealed in their <em>trunks</em>,
together with pawnbrokers' duplicates for the contents of the Grand Junction
reservoir, and the City basin, both of which had suddenly disappeared in a very
mysterious manner, and having been at low water of late, and much run upon,
owing to the dry weather, were supposed to have run away. The culprits showed
their teeth at the charge, as hard as ivory, and speechified at length, but a clear
case being established, they offered their <em>pledges</em> for better behaviour; however,
the worthy magistrate stopped their <em>spouting</em>, and sent them to the treadmill. The
office was crowded by members of the Temperance Society, several of whom offered
to become bail for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>21st.—At the last Drawing Room, Captain Bodkin had the honour of presenting
Cleopatra's needle to the Queen. Her Majesty was pleased to send to <em>Cable
Street</em> for a hundred yards of <em>Wopping</em> Thread, and in the evening one of the
maids of honour used it, by Her Majesty's desire, to work a button-hole of a new
shirt for Mister O'Killus in the park.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>August</span> 4th.—On Sunday, the 2nd, Lord H. visited the Bear-pit in the Zoological
Gardens, and leaning too far over the wall, fell among the interesting
animals, who were so alarmed at the sight that they were seized with convulsions,
and have been in a nervous state ever since.</p>

<p class='c000'>17th.—An old woman was charged with selling apples on a Sunday morning.
She was too poor to keep a <em>shop</em>, so was committed to the <em>Counter</em>. It appeared
that her basket obstructed the people in their way to the Gravesend Sunday
boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>26th.—A steam-boat party going down the river for a Marine <em>Gala</em>, were caught
in a <em>gale</em>. The Catastrophe happened off the Isle of <em>Dogs</em>, and the hurricane
<em>setting</em> in during a Quadrille, they tried in vain to stand <em>firm</em>, for <em>partners</em> were
driven "right and left;" the "Ladies' chain" was broken off in the middle, and
"The Lancers" totally put to the rout. The chimney <em>fell</em> in the midst of a <em>cadence</em>,
and the mast was <em>shivered</em> during a <em>shake</em>, but the musicians were all ruined, for
their instruments were blown <em>beyond Fidlers' reach</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><span class='sc'>Sept.</span> 1st.—The Duke of Nemours, with his suite, rode through Coventry Street,
when the figure of Fieschi became visibly agitated, and attempted to discharge
the Infernal Machine at him. Nothing but its being a sham, and not loaded,
saved the Duke from the fate intended for his father.</p>

<p class='c000'>5th.—The Ladies' Brazen Monument to the Duke of Wellington, having been
<em>smoked</em> a good deal of late, its noble proprietresses determined on giving it an
autumnal washing before the fall of the leaf. For this purpose, the (Holy)
Alliance Company lent their engine, a fiery Marquess played the pipe, and a committee
of Countesses worked the pumps. The figure was then invested in a new
shirt, presented by Her Majesty, against the cold weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>20th.—A sailing party from Margate, finding themselves near <em>Urn</em> bay, resolved
to drink <em>tea</em>. Mrs. Bullion, of Cheapside, one of the company, proposed music in
the air, and, being inspired by the water, volunteered "The Land;" but, in getting
up to C above, she overreached herself, and fell into the sea below. At first, Mr.
Bullion feared she would prove <em>dead stock</em> on his hands, but he soon saw she was
<em>floating, capital</em>; so he bargained with some <em>dredgers</em> to give her an <em>hoister</em> on board
again. The <em>natives</em> were greatly alarmed at the occurrence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Oct.</span> 3rd.—Mrs. Belasco delivered her concluding Lecture on morality, with
illustrations, in the Saloon of the Haymarket Theatre.</p>

<p class='c000'>7th.—The Penitentiary at Millbank was partly destroyed by fire; luckily the
flames were extinguished, without making an auto-da-fé of the fair penitents,
many of whom were insured by destiny from that sort of untimely end. The
treadmill was unfortunately burnt, to the great inconvenience of several industrious
persons who were practising on it, to qualify themselves for places of service where
there was a good deal of running upstairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>12th.—The paupers of Gripeham workhouse having been, under the new law,
deprived of their tobacco, deputed one old woman, as the <em>organ</em> of the rest, to
demand a restoration of their <em>pipes</em>. The overseers withstood her <em>fire</em>, and refused
her <em>smoke</em>; however, at the suggestion of one of their body who had learned Latin,
they consented to allow her a "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Quid</em> pro quo</span>."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Nov.</span> 15th.—The Society for the Protection of Animals held its yearly meeting.
The report stated, that in Billingsgate their efforts had met with great success.
In the following meritorious cases the large silver medal was awarded:—To Diana
Finn, for cracking the necks of a pound of eels before she skinned them; to Simon
Soft, for boiling his lobsters in cold water; to Ephraim Hacket, for crimping cod
with a blunted knife; and to Felix Flat, for refusing to open live oysters. In
other quarters humanity was also progressing, and prizes were given to Hans
Lever, for drubbing a donkey with the <em>thin</em> end of his cudgel, at the request of an
officer of this Society; and to Nicodemus Nacks, for consenting to keep a plaster
on his pony's <em>raw</em>, except on pleasure parties, and other occasions requiring extra
persuasion. The thanks of the Society were voted to Daniel Dozer, Esq., of New
River Head, for using dead worms as a bait: and the gold medal to the same gentleman,
for his practice of angling without hooking the fish. A premium was also
offered by the Society for some preparation of ox(h)ide of iron, which shall enable
a bullock's back to resist a whacking.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dec.</span> 7th.—Sir Harcourt Lees was frightened into fits by O'Connell's ghost,
which appeared in the shape of a moving <em>Mass</em>, with cloven feet, a long <em>tail</em>, and
the <em>Pope's eye</em> in the middle of his forehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>18th.—During the exhibition of the gas microscope, the water tigers, irritated
by the intense blaze of light to which they were exposed, after several tremendous
efforts to escape, broke from their confinement, and sprang among the spectators.
Three young ladies from a boarding school were instantly devoured. The ferocious
animals next turned their attention to the governess and an old teacher, who,
proving rather tough, afforded time for their keeper to secure them, which he did
by re-absorbing them in a drop of water on the point of a needle.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><em>Extracts from the Proceedings of the Association of British<br /> Illuminati, at their Annual Meeting, held in Dublin,<br /> August, 1835.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Dr. Hoaxum</span> read an interesting paper on the conversion of moonbeams
into substance, and rendering shadows permanent, both of which he had
recently exemplified in the establishment of some public companies, whose
prospectuses he laid upon the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Babble produced his calculating machine, and its wonderful powers
were tested in many ways by the audience. It supplied to Captain Sir John
North an accurate computation of the distance between a quarto volume
and a cheesemonger's shop; and solved a curious question as to the decimal
proportions of cunning and credulity, which, worked by the rule of allegation,
would produce a product of 10,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Von Hammer described his newly-discovered process for breaking
stones by an algebraic fraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Crowsfoot read a paper on the natural history of the Rook. He defended
their <em>caws</em> with great <em>effect</em>, and proved that there is not a <em>grain</em>
of truth in the charges against them, which only arise from <em>Grub</em> Street
malice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rev. Mr. Groper exhibited the skin of a toad, which he discovered
alive in a mass of sandstone. The animal was found engaged on its auto-biography,
and died of fright on having its house so suddenly broken into,
being probably of a nervous habit from passing so much time alone. Some
extracts from its memoir were read, and found exceedingly interesting. Its
thoughts on the "silent system" of prison discipline, though written <em>in the
dark</em>, strictly agreed with those of our most <em>enlightened</em> political economists.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Deady read a scientific paper on the manufacture of Hydro-<em>gin</em>, which
greatly interested those of the association who were members of Temperance
Societies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Croak laid on the table an essay from the Cabinet Makers' Society, on
the construction of <em>frog-stools</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Parley exhibited his speaking machine, which distinctly articulated
the words "<em>Repale! Repale!</em>" to the great delight of many of the
audience. The learned Professor stated that he was engaged on another,
for the use of his Majesty's Ministers, which would already say, "My
Lords and Gentlemen;" and he doubted not, by the next meeting of Parliament,
would be able to pronounce the whole of the opening speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Multiply produced, and explained the principle of, his exaggerating
machine. He displayed its amazing powers on the mathematical point,
which, with little trouble, was made to appear as large as a coach-wheel.
He demonstrated its utility in all the relations of society, as applied to the
failings of the absent—the growth of a tale of scandal—the exploits of
travellers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Author of the "Pleasures of Hope" presented, through a member, a
very amusing Essay on the gratification arising from the throttling of crying
children; but as the ladies would not leave the room, it could not be read.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain North exhibited some shavings of the real Pole, and a small
bottle which, he asserted, contained scintillations of the Aurora Borealis,
from which, he stated, he had succeeded in extracting pure gold. He
announced that his nephew was preparing for a course of similar experiments,
of which he expected to know the result in October. The gallant Captain
then favoured the company with a dissertation on phrenology, of which, he
said, he had been a believer for thirty years. He stated that he had made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>many valuable verifications of that science on the skulls of the Esquimaux;
and that, in his recent tour in quest of subscribers to his book, his great
success had been mainly attributable to his phrenological skill; for that,
whenever he had an opportunity of feeling for soft places in the heads of the
public, he knew in a moment whether he should get a customer or not. He
said that whether in the examination of ships' heads or sheep's heads—in the
choice of horses or housemaids, he had found the science of pre-eminent
utility. He related the following remarkable phrenological cases:—A man
and woman were executed in Scotland for murder on presumptive evidence;
but another criminal confessed to the deed, and a reprieve arrived the day
after the execution. The whole country was horrified; but Captain North
having examined their heads, he considered, from the extraordinary size of
their destructive organs, that the sentence was prospectively just, for they
must have become murderers, had they escaped hanging then. Their infant
child, of six months old, was brought to him, and perceiving on its head the
same fatal tendencies, he determined to avert the evil; for which purpose, by
means of a pair of moulds, he so compressed the skull in its vicious propensities,
and enlarged it in its virtuous ones, that the child grew up a model
of perfection. The second instance was of a married couple, whose lives
were a continued scene of discord till they parted. On examining their
heads scientifically, he discovered the elementary causes of their unhappiness.
Their skulls were unfortunately too thick to be treated as in the foregoing
case; but, causing both their heads to be shaved, he by dint of planing down
in some places, and laying on padding in others, contrived to produce all
the requisite phrenological developments, and they were then living a perfect
pattern of conjugal felicity, "a thing which could not have happened
without phrenology." (This dissertation was received with loud applauses
from the entire assembly, whose phrenological organs becoming greatly
excited, and developed in an amazing degree by the enthusiasm of the
subject, they all fell to examining each others' bumps with such eagerness
that the meeting dissolved in confusion.)</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE DERBY DAY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here's a right and true list of all the running horses! Dorling's correct
card for the Derby day!——Hollo, old un! hand us up one here, will
you: and let it be a good un: there, now what's to pay?</p>

<p class='c010'>Only sixpence. Sixpence! I never gave more than a penny at Hookem
Snivey in all my days.——May be not, your honour: but Hookem Snivey
aint Hepsom: and sixpence is what every gemman, as is a gemman, pays.</p>

<p class='c010'>I can buy 'em for less than that on the course, and I'll wait till I get there.
Beg your honour's pardon; they sells 'em a shillin' on the course.
Give you threepence. They cost <em>me</em> fippence ha'p'ny farden.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, here then, take your list back again. Come, come; your honour shall
have it at your own price:——I wouldn't sell it nob'dy else for no sitch
money: but I likes the sound of your wice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here, then, give me the change, will you?—Oh, certainly: but your honour's
honcommon ard:——Let's see: you want two-and-threepence: wait a
moment, there's another gentleman calling out for a card.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hollo, coachman, stop, stop! Coachman, do you hear? stop your horses this
moment, and let me get down:——The fellow's run away behind an
omnibus without giving me change out of my half-crown.</p>

<p class='c010'>That's alvays the vay they does on these here hoccasions: they calls it
catching a flat:——Sorry I can't stop. Where's the new police? Pretty
police truly, to suffer such work as that!</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, if ever I come to Epsom again! but let's look at the list: it's cost me
precious dear!——Ascot, Mundig, Pelops! why, good heavens, coachman!
they've sold me a list for last year!</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, ma! look there! what a beautiful carriage! scarlet and gold liveries, and
horses with long tails.——And stodge-full of gentlemen with mustaches,
and cigars, and Macintoshes, and green veils:</p>

<p class='c010'>Whose is it, ma? Don't know, my dear; but no doubt belongs to some duke,
or marquis, or other great nob.——Beg your pardon, ma'am: but that
carriage as you're looking at is a party of the swell mob.</p>

<p class='c010'>And, oh my! ma: look at that other, full of beautiful ladies, dressed like
queens and princesses.——Silks and satins and velvets, and gauze sleeves
and ermine tippets: I never saw such elegant dresses:</p>

<p class='c010'>And how merry they look, laughing and smiling! they seem determined to
enjoy the sport:——Who are they, ma? Don't know, dear; but no doubt
they're Court ladies. Yes, ma'am, Cranbourne Court.</p>

<p class='c010'>How do, Smith? nice sort of tit you've got there. Very nice indeed: <em>very</em>
nice sort of mare.——Beautiful legs she's got, and nicely-turned ancles,
and 'pon my word, a most elegant head of hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>How old is she? and how high does she stand? I should like to buy her if
she's for sale.——Oh, she's quite young: not above five-and-twenty or
thirty; and her height exactly a yard and a half and a nail:</p>

<p class='c010'>Price eighty guineas. She'd be just the thing for you; capital hunter as
ever appeared at a fixture.——Only part with her on account of her
colour; not that <em>I</em> mind: only Mrs. S. don't like an <em>Oxford mixture</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hehlo! you faylow! you person smoking the pipe, I wish you'd take your
quadruped out of the way.——Quadruped, eh? you be blowed! it's no
quadruped, but as good a donkey as ever was fed upon hay.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, my! ma; there's the course. What lots of people, and horses, and booths,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and grand stands.——And what oceans of gipsies and jugglers, and
barrel organs, and military bands!</p>

<p class='c010'>And was ever such sights of Savoyards and French women singing and
E-O-tables;——And horses rode up and down by little boys, or tied
together in bundles, and put up in calimanco stables;</p>

<p class='c010'>And look at that one, they call him <em>Boney</em>-parte. Did you ever in all your
lifetime see a leaner?——And "Royal Dinner Saloons" (for royalty the
knives might have been a little brighter, and the linen a little cleaner);</p>

<p class='c010'>And women with last-dying speeches in one hand, and in the other all the
best new comic songs;——And, dear me! how funnily that gentleman
sits his horse; for all the world just like a pair of tongs.</p>

<p class='c010'>And—clear the course! clear the course! Oh, dear! now the great Derby
race is going to be run.——Twelve to one! Ten to one! Six to one!
Nine to two! Sixteen to three! Done, done, done, done!</p>

<p class='c010'>Here they come! here they come! blue, green buff, yellow, black, brown,
white, harlequin, and red!——Sir, I wish you'd stand off of our carriage
steps: it's quite impossible to see through your head.</p>

<p class='c010'>There, now they're gone: how many times round? Times round, eh? why,
bless your innocent face!——It's all over. All over! you don't say so!
I wish I'd never come: such a take in! call that a Derby race!</p>

<p class='c010'>After being stifled with dust almost, and spoiling all our best bonnets and
shawls and cloaks!——Call that a Derby race, indeed! I'm sure it's no
Derby, but nothing but a right-down, regular <em>Oaks</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>But come, let's have a bit of lunch: I'm as hungry as if I hadn't had a bit all
day.——Smith, what are you staring at? why don't you make haste,
and hand us the hamper this way?</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall never have anything to eat all day if you don't stir yourself, and not
go on at that horrid slow rate.——Oh, Lord! the bottom's out, and every
bit of meat and drink, and worse than all, the knives and forks and plate,—</p>

<p class='c010'>Stole and gone clean away! Good heavenlies! and I told you to keep your
eye on the basket, you stupid lout!——Well, so I did, on the <em>top</em> of it,
but who'd have thought of their taking the bottom out?</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, never mind: they'll be prettily disappointed: for you know, betwixt
you and me and the wall,——Our ivory knives and forks were nothing
but bone; and our plate nothing but German silver, after all.</p>

<p class='c010'>What race is to be run next? No more, ma'am: the others were all run
afore you come.——Well, then, have the horses put to, Smith: I'll never
come a Derbying again; and let us be off home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, lawk! what a stodge of carriages! I'm sure we shall never get off the
course alive!——Oh, dear! do knock that young drunken gentleman off
the box: I'm sure he's not in a fit state to drive.</p>

<p class='c010'>There, I told you how it would be. Oh, law! you've broke my arm, and compound-fractured
my leg!——Oh! for 'eavens sake, lift them two 'orrid
osses off my darter! Sir, take your hands out of my pocket-hole, I beg!</p>

<p class='c010'>I say, the next time you crawl out of a coach window, I wish you wouldn't
put your foot on a lady's chest.——Vell, if ever I seed such a purl as
that (and I've seed many a good un in my time) I'll be blest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, dear! going home's worse than coming! It's ten to one if ever we get
back to Tooley Street alive.——Such jostling, and pushing, and prancing
of horses! and always the tipsiest gentleman of every party <em>will</em> drive.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wish I was one of those ladies at the windows; or even one of the servant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>maids giggling behind the garden walls.——And oh! there's Kennington
turnpike! what shouting and hooting, and blowing those horrid cat-calls!</p>

<p class='c010'>Ticket, Sir? got a ticket? No, I've lost it. A shilling, then. A shilling!
I've paid you once to-day.——Oh, yes, I suppose so: the old tale; but it
wont do. That's what all you sporting gentlemen say.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hinsolent feller! I'll have you up before your betters. Come, sir, you
musn't stop up the way. Well, I'll pay you again; but, oh Lord! somebody's
stole my purse! good gracious, what shall I do!——I suppose I
must leave my watch, and call for it to-morrow. Oh, ruination! blow'd
if that isn't gone too!</p>

<p class='c010'>Get on there, will you?—Well, stop a moment. Will anybody lend me a shilling?
No? Well, here then, take my hat:——But if I don't show you
up in <em>Bell's Life in London</em> next Sunday morning, my name's not
Timothy Flat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, this is my last journey to Epsom, my last appearance on any course as
a backer or hedger:——For I see plain enough a betting-book aint a day-book,
and a Derby's a very different thing from a Ledger.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A PARALLEL CASE OF HARDSHIP.</h3>

<p class='c016'>A public subscription of several thousand pounds has been proposed to be
raised towards Mr. Buckingham's losses in India; quickened by the threat
that, if not sufficient to maintain him, he would be driven to the very dreadful
necessity of "devoting the remainder of his days to useful and honourable
labour!" To avert so dire a calamity, it will be proposed among Mr. B.'s
friends to revive the old project, and send him round the world on a voyage
of discovery and commerce. He is to sail on the <em>first</em> of next <em>April</em>, and
will take with him passengers, emigrants, and merchandize. First exploring
the British coast, he will establish a colony of tailors at <em>Sheer</em>-ness; then
offer a consignment of saddles and bridles to the inhabitants of <em>Ryde</em>;
afterwards call for Mr. Ole <em>Bull</em> off <em>Cowes</em>, as fiddler to the crew; from
thence he will despatch a bale of <em>blankets</em> to <em>Friez</em>-land, and of <em>gloves</em> to the
people of <em>Pau</em>, taking in exchange some cheap <em>coffee</em> for charitable purposes
from <em>Cham-berry</em>. Proceeding through the Channel, he will receive a few
distressed ladies at <em>Bride</em>port on an experimental voyage to <em>Beau</em>-maris.
The <em>late</em> ministry will accompany him as far as the <em>Ex</em>, and at <em>Ply-Mouth
Sound</em> he will take in the <em>substance</em> of his next parliamentary campaign.
At the <em>Scilly</em> Islands he will try to dispose of a heavy consignment from
Paternoster Row and some leading establishments at the west-end of the
town. He will leave the Poor Law Commissioners at their headquarters
at <em>Flint</em>; thence crossing the Atlantic, he will deposit the bones of Mr.
Carus Wilson at <em>Long</em> Island, and offer a cargo of <em>soft-soap</em> at <em>Washing</em>ton.
He will next despatch <em>Stone masons</em> to the <em>Chipaway</em> country, and Carpenters
to the <em>Chick-a-saws</em>, and he will be commissioned to get a lot of <em>old
Joes</em> exchanged at <em>New-Found-Land</em>. He will supply the natives of <em>Chili</em>
with <em>great coats</em>, carry <em>ham</em> and <em>beef</em> to the <em>Sandwich</em> Islands, and <em>broad
cloth</em> to <em>Bombay</em>. He will then reach the North Pole by taking up his ship
in an air balloon, and remaining suspended, till, as the world goes round,
the arctic circle is just under his feet, when he will drop into the midst of
it. Coming home from the North, about next St. Swithin twelvemonths,
he will bring us a little <em>Blue</em> from the Island of <em>Skye</em>, and call off the
coast of <em>Ayr</em>-shire for another scheme to raise the <em>wind</em>. On his arrival,
the wooden guns at Jack Straw's Castle will be fired, and the town illuminated
with <em>moonshine</em>.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c000'><span class='sc'>Divaricating</span> from the beaten track of all my predecessors in
the Celestial Art, whose method it hath ever been to leave the
interpretation of their symbolical prefigurements to be explorated and
divined by the subtlety of the ingenious reader himself,—by the which
they did shroud, in a tenfold tenebrosity of Cimmerian gloom, their
no-meaning mysteries, and ambiguous puzzlements;—deviating, I
say, from such a course, I do herewith not only present thee, as hath
been my custom, with an Hieroglyphic "adapted to the times," but
lifting the veil of obscurity, wherein it is shrouded from vulgar apprehension,
lay patent and exposed the hidden meaning thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>It hath in it the three grand postulates or requirements of a
veritable Hieroglyphic, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">videlicet</span></i>,—It is Astroscopical, Astrological,
and Prophetical:—</p>

<p class='c000'>It is <em>Astroscopical</em>, as it is founded on an observation of the Stars.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is <em>Astrological</em>, as it is indicative of planetary potency and
lunar influence; and</p>

<p class='c000'>It is <em>Prophetical</em>, inasmuch as it not only presenteth the present,
but futurizeth the future.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Taurus</em>, the <em>Bull</em> (egregious John!), having, through a plethora
of purse, fallen into a dreamy mood, yielded himself up to a somniferous
influence, which becloudeth, with a misty obfuscation, his
natural senses; whereupon the megrims of his crazy brain do set
themselves to work, and conjure up certain airy visions of speculative
aggrandizement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Floating <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in nubibus</span></i> before his fancy's eye, are sundry bubbles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>blown by an Imp of Speculation, who ruleth the phantasies which
do take John's imagination captive. <em>Gemini</em> (the Twins) in the
similitude of a joint-stock Company proffer him wealth;—baseless
castles, of unsubstantial fabric, resting on ether, do shadow forth
his brick-and-mortar predilections;—and a rail-road betwixt Dover
and Calais, uniting that which nature had dissevered, accomplisheth
that propinquity, which John ever affecteth for good neighbourhood
and fellowship; while <em>Luna</em>, who hath established a reciprocity rail-road
with our planet, grinneth at his gullibility, and marketh him
for her own.</p>

<p class='c000'>Descending from the clouds, note we the state of his household
matters, while he thus dreameth in complacent security.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thou mayest observe, gentle Reader, certain satellites of <em>Mercury</em>
(the planet of thieves), who, under the impersonation of rooks, by
an immersion of their long beaks into the profundity of his pockets,
are abstracting his treasure. At the right hand of the dreamer, a
cutpurse knave of Spades, the apt symbol of rail-road diggers and
miners, hath, by an undermining trick, possessed himself of his
bullion; while the Demon of Gin, in the likelihood of a crafty
serpent, entwined round his lower extremities, shadoweth forth the
ruin with which the fiend spirit threateneth the props of the body
politic,—the Industrious Classes. The rats, those rogues in grain, are
devouring his corn; and his faithful Tray is gnawing at his dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Surrounded as he is by wealth and plenty, shall we marvel, that
when the master of the house sleepeth on his post, knaves will cheat,
thieves will steal, and servants will pilfer?</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>MISS AMELIA SMITH TO MISS JULIA SMYTHE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>"<span class='sc'>Dearest Julia</span>,—Since that very unpleasant affair of pa's bankruptcy,
which made it so disagreeable to stop in town, I have really not had a
moment to spare. I take the first opportunity to tell you that our farming
goes on quite as well as might be expected; and I hope in a few years we
shall be able to hold up our heads again in our dear native Tooley Street,
and among our friends at dear No. 29½.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Haymaking is just over, and such fun! Oh, how I wished for you, dear
Julia! you would so have liked it!—tedding, and windrowing, and staddle-rowing,
and quilling, and above all, being rolled about and tumbled to bits
by the young Browns, our handsome neighbours, who kindly offered their assistance
on this occasion. Young Edwin, who paid particular attention to
me, and squeezed my best transparent muslin bonnet to a mummy, and tore
my green silk frock all to rags, is one of the nicest young men in these parts,
and a great favourite with us all. Pa and ma sat on a bank directing our
proceedings out of a book pa's got, which tells you all about farming, and
agriculture, and everything. I am head shepherdess, and go out every
morning with my crook and Spanish guitar, and sit all day long on a bank
playing to the sheep and lambs; young Edwin Brown generally coming and
keeping me company with his German flute, which makes it very pleasant.
Besides having the care of the flocks, I am put in charge of the eggs and
poultry; but, though I have every reason to believe that our hens lay regularly,
I cannot for the life of me find their nests: and I assure you I have
searched over and over again in all the trees about the premises. The only
eggs I have been able to get were some brought in by pa the other day, and
which I immediately set under a Bantam hen; but, unfortunately, they
turned out nothing but snakes. Also a second lot, picked up by brother
John in one of his walks, which unluckily proving to be pheasants, poor
John has been informed against by a neighbouring gamekeeper, and will
have to pay goodness knows what penalty, and has got the character of a
poacher into the bargain. What a fuss is here about poaching a few eggs!</p>

<p class='c000'>"My geese also have been very disappointing, though we have had the
tank in front of the house carefully covered in with invisible wire for their
accommodation, where they are kept night and day, and have fresh water
given them every morning. Ducks likewise don't go on very swimmingly;
and as to our horned cattle, things have gone very crooked. Pa bought a
lot of cows, and thereby hangs a tale, for on bringing them up to milk
we couldn't get a drop; and on inquiry found that he ought to have bought
milch cows, and not feeding cows, which are only used for making beef of.
But he soon bought others, and we have now a very good dairy, and Lucy
is quite pat at making butter, but mamma is rather green at making cheese.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Brother John attends the markets—not that we have anything to sell—but
it is considered regular; and indeed he makes a regular thing of it
by getting tipsy every market day. Emily, who, you know, was always very
fond of birds, bought a lot of pigeons, and a tame hawk, and a jackdaw; but,
unfortunately, the hawk got one day into the dovecot, and killed every one of
the pigeons; and the jackdaw has stolen all our silver forks and spoons.
Brother John purchased a lot more pigeons at the market, which flew away
the next morning; and pa, in his rage, wrung the jackdaw's neck, so that
we are safe to see no more of our forks and spoons.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ma undertook to manage the bees, and has had a glass hive fixed at her
bed-room window. The first night she was very unlucky; for, getting up in
the dark to open the window, she forgot the bees, and smashed one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>hives, whereupon the little savages flew at her and almost stung her to death;
and pa, who heard her cries and jumped out of bed to her assistance, got as
roughly handled as ma. Only fancy, Julia dear, being in nothing but your
chemise, and two hundred thousand bees stinging at you like mad! not
pleasant, is it?</p>

<p class='c000'>"Our pig-sties, I am sorry to say, are quite empty, the pigs having strayed
and got into the parish pound (unknown to us, of course), where they were
at last sold to pay their expenses. Susan, however, has been very successful
in rearing a litter of Guinea pigs, and Emily has got a most delightful lot
of little peacocks. Also John, who has bought a hunter and means to follow
the hounds, has had wonderful luck with his foxes, for whose accommodation
he has planted two of our largest fields full of gorse bushes. A singular
thing occurred the other day with regard to one of these creatures: he was
seen retreating to the gorse covert, closely pursued by one of the turkeys;
and, more singular still, the turkey has never since been heard of, and it is
generally supposed that it followed the fox into one of its holes and got suffocated.
Several of the chickens have also disappeared in a very mysterious
way, and we can only account for it in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Our health is capital—except ma, who has got the lumbago by sitting
without her shawl in the hay-field—and pa, who is laid up with a cold and
sore throat from standing in the draught of a winnowing machine—and
Emily, who has got a face as big as two with running to fetch the young
ducks out of the rain—and Abraham, who has almost cut his hand off with
pruning the damson trees—and John, who, I am afraid, has lamed himself
for life in trying to jump his horse over a five-barred gate with spikes on it—and
your humble servant, who has put out one of her wrists, and sprained
one of her ancles, and fractured one of her ribs in climbing up a tree after
a hen's nest—or rather, a magpie's. My wrist is so bad at this moment that
you must excuse my abruptly signing myself,</p>

<p class='c000'>"P.S. Wrist or no wrist, I must tell you of the perfidy of that villain,
Edwin Brown. Ma has just been in to say that he has run away with his
father's dairymaid. A perjured wretch! and a dairymaid too! I have for-sworn
love for ever, and made over my sheep to Emily. Oh, Julia!</p>

<p class='c000'>"P.S. I open this sheet to tell you of the shocking fire that happened here
last night. We might have all been burnt to death in our beds. The barns,
stables, and other out-buildings are reduced to cinders; and all owing to
William's fine rick of hay, which it seems was put up too green, and took
fire of its own accord. Very odd—pa's book never said a word about it. We
are all very miserable.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OPERATION OF THE NEW POOR LAWS.</h3>

<p class='c016'>A man in the last stage of destitution came before the sitting magistrate
at Lambeth Street, and stated, that having by the operation of the New
Poor Laws been suddenly deprived of parish assistance, he was reduced to
such extremity, that, if not instantly relieved, he must be driven to do a
deed that his soul abhorred. The worthy magistrate instantly ordered him
five shillings from the poor-box, and after a suitable admonition against giving
way to despair, asked him what dreadful deed he would have been impelled
to but for this seasonable relief? "To work!" said the man, with a deep
sigh, as he left the office.</p>

 <td class='blt c014' colspan='3' rowspan='35'> The sun of Bartlemy is well-nigh set, and his latest rays
 are dull as the Dutch metal that gilds his gingerbread
 kings. The last fair was a foul concern--the lions roared in
 a saw-dust solitude and the monkeys chatter'd to empty
 boxes.--"Just going to begin" was a never-ending cry,
 because the sights waited all day for want of see-ers--Mr.
 Merryman was sad, for people would not down with the
 dumps; and though he cried "Walk up! only twopence,"
 he failed to "take his change out of that." In vain King
 Richard offer'd his kingdom for a horse; there were only a
 few asses within ear-ing. The sausages met with no stuffers,
 and the dog-meat pies remained unbitten, though the chimney-
 sweeps looked rabid at 'em. The hot spiced nuts met
 with a cold reception; the baked plum pudding was at no
 price current; and the ginger beer, though well up, would
 not go down. The pyramids of apples stood as unmoved as
 those of Egypt; but the nuts alone looked happy, for the
 people gave them "none of their jaw." The temperance
 societies have turned the table to a T;--Men who have left
 off gin do not support Mr. Gingell; and water-drinkers have
 no affection for fire-eaters. As to the gin temples, they
 found their day pretty well over, so they blazed at night, but
 their illuminated dials have made the world suspect "what's
 o'clock." Even the pickpockets failed of their harvest: for
 as the people abandoned the knaves in spirit, they were
 able to guard against the rogues in grain.</td>

<p class='c016'>"And that's why I don't like a flinty soil," said the farmer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Talking of flints," said the gentleman in the India-rubber coat, white
cords, and top-boots, "we'd a werry honcommon day's sport shooting, the
First of September ultimo: vich there vos me and Figgins, and Wiggins,
and Higgins, and young Apollo Belvidere Hicks, the poet, vot writes werses
in <em>Bell's Life</em>, and sends wery anonymous letters to the <em>Penny Magazine</em>,
and sings a werry good song now and then at the Adelphi Shades—a werry
slap-up party, I assure you. I writ an account of it at the time, vich I sent
to <em>Bell's Life</em>; but owing to a werry great press of matter of tempory
hinterest, vosn't hable to be printed. I've got the journal in my pocket, and
if you like, I'll read it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"By all means," said a chorus of voices. Whereupon the gentleman in
the India-rubber coat, white cords, and top-boots, <em>douted</em> his half-smoked
cigar, stowed it away in his silver-mounted shagreen case, and pulling out
an amateur-built note-book, made of half-a-dozen sheets of blue-lined paper,
evidently purloined from the ledger, read as follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

    <div>"JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS ON THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER ULT.</div>
    <div class='c002'>"<em>Edited by Jonathan Duggins, Esq.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>"Up at six.—Told Mrs. D. I'd got wery pressing business at Woolwich,
and off to Old Fish Street, where a werry sporting breakfast, consisting of
jugged hare, partridge pie, tally-ho sauce, gunpowder tea, and-cætera, vos
laid out in Figgins's warehouse; as he didn't choose Mrs. F. and his young
hinfant family to know he vos a-goin to hexpose himself vith fire-harms.—
After a good blow-out, sallied forth vith our dogs and guns, namely Mrs.
Wiggins's French poodle, Miss Selina Higgins's real Blenheim spaniel, young
Hicks's ditto, Mrs. Figgins's pet bull-dog, and my little thorough-bred tarrier;
all vich had been smuggled to Figgins's warehouse the night before, to perwent
domestic disagreeables.—Got into a Paddington bus at the Bank.—Row
with Tiger, who hobjected to take the dogs, unless paid hextra.—Hicks said
we'd a rights to take 'em, and quoted the hact.—Tiger said the hact
only allowed parcels carried on the lap.—Accordingly tied up the dogs in
our pocket-handkerchiefs, and carried them and the guns on our knees.—Got
down at Paddington; and, after glasses round, valked on till ve got into
the fields, to a place vich Higgins had baited vith corn and penny rolls every
day for a month past. Found a covey of birds feeding. Dogs wery eager,
and barked beautiful. Birds got up, and turned out to be pigeons. Debate
as to vether pigeons vos game or not. Hicks said they vos made game on
by the new hact. Fired accordingly, and half killed two or three, vich half
fell to the ground; but suddenly got up again and flew off. Reloaded, and
pigeons came round again. Let fly a second time, and tumbled two or three
more over, but didn't bag any. Tired at last, and turned in to the <em>Dog and
Partridge</em> to get a snack. Landlord laughed, and asked how ve vos hoff for
tumblers. Didn't understand him, but got some waluable hinformation about
loading our guns; vich he strongly recommended mixing the powder and
shot well up together before putting into the barrel; and showed Figgins
how to charge his percussion; vich, being Figgins's first attempt under the
new system, he had made the mistake of putting a charge of copper caps into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the barrel instead of sticking von of 'em atop of the touch-hole.—Left the <em>Dog
and Partridge</em>, and took a north-easterly direction, so as to have the adwantage
of the vind on our backs. Dogs getting wery riotous, and refusing to
answer to Figgins's vhistle, vich had unfortunately got a pea in it.—Getting
over an edge into a field, Hicks's gun haccidentally hexploded, and shot
Wiggins behind; and my gun going off hunexpectedly at the same moment,
singed avay von of my viskers and blinded von of my heyes.—Carried
Wiggins back to the inn: dressed his wound, and rubbed my heye with
cherry brandy and my visker vith bear's grease.—Sent poor W. home by a
short stage, and resumed our sport.—Heard some pheasants crowing by the
side of a plantation. Resolved to stop their cockadoodledooing, so set off at
a jog-trot. Passing thro' a field of bone manure, the dogs unfortunately set
to work upon the bones, and we couldn't get 'em to go a step further at no
price. Got vithin gun-shot of two of the birds, vich Higgins said they vos
two game cocks: but Hicks, who had often been to Vestminster Pit, said no
sitch thing; as game cocks had got short square tails, and smooth necks,
and long military spurs; and these had got long curly tails, and necks all
over hair, and scarce any spurs at all. Shot at 'em as pheasants, and believe
we killed 'em both; but, hearing some orrid screams come out of the plantation
immediately hafter, ve all took to our 'eels and ran avay vithout stopping
to pick either of 'em up.—After running about two miles, Hicks called out
to stop, as he had hobserved a covey of wild ducks feeding on a pond by the
road side. Got behind a haystack and shot at the ducks, vich svam avay
hunder the trees. Figgins wolunteered to scramble down the bank, and
hook out the dead uns vith the but-hend of his gun. Unfortunately bank
failed, and poor F. tumbled up to his neck in the pit. Made a rope of our
pocket hankerchiefs, got it round his neck, and dragged him to the <em>Dog and
Doublet</em>, vere ve had him put to bed, and dried. Werry sleepy with the
hair and hexercise, so after dinner took a nap a-piece.—Woke by the landlord
coming in to know if ve vos the gentlemen as had shot the hunfortunate nurse-maid
and child in Mr. Smithville's plantation. Swore ve knew nothing about
it, and vile the landlord vas gone to deliver our message, got out of the back
vindow, and ran avay across the fields. At the end of a mile, came suddenly
upon a strange sort of bird, vich Hicks declared to be the cock-of-the-woods.
Sneaked behind him and killed him. Turned out to be a peacock. Took to
our heels again, as ve saw the lord of the manor and two of his servants vith
bludgeons coming down the gravel valk towards us. Found it getting late, so
agreed to shoot our vay home. Didn't know vere ve vos, but kept going on.—At
last got to a sort of plantation, vere ve saw a great many birds perching
about. Gave 'em a broadside, and brought down several. Loaded again, and
killed another brace. Thought ve should make a good day's vork of it at last,
and was preparing to charge again, ven two of the new police came and took us
up in the name of the Zolorogical Society, in whose gardens it seems ve had
been shooting. Handed off to the Public Hoffice, and werry heavily fined,
and werry sewerely reprimanded by the sitting magistrate.—Coming away,
met by the landlord of the <em>Dog and Doublet</em>, who charged us with running
off without paying our shot; and Mr. Smithville, who accused us of man-slaughtering
his nurse-maid and child; and, their wounds not having been
declared immortal, ve vos sent to spend the night in prison—and thus ended
my last First of September."</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>SO—OH!—LOGICAL SOCIETY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>At the Annual Meeting of the So-oh!-logical Society, the Chairman,
in an able speech, which was highly satisfactory to himself and
all present, congratulated the members on the prosperous state of
the concern. He informed them that their coffers and their dens were
yet undrained; that they were still able to raise the wind, though
they had very little ventilation; that the shilling orders were on the
increase, though the animals were in a decline; and, admitting that
some of them had galloped off in a consumption, there was a consolation
in the old adage, that living asses were far better than dead
lions,—a truth of which they must all feel a full conviction.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stated that 15,073 pennyworths of apples, 10,732 gingerbread
cakes, and 6,532 half-pints of nuts had been sold during the year by
the old lady who sits at the bear-pit; that a Sunday school had
been established in the Gardens, under the superintendence of a
committee of noblemen, for the purpose of instructing the apes and
monkeys in the art of smoking cigars, and other usages of fashionable
life; but that the throngs of ladies who crowded round them
during school-hours had greatly retarded their improvement, by
staring them out of countenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>He thought it right to mention to the Meeting that the Council,
in the choice of the Society's servants, had borne in mind that mere
experience is but empiricism, and they had discovered that whoever
could wash a coach-wheel could water a rhinoceros; that an over-grown
<em>Tiger</em> was a proper person to feed a Lion, and the offsprings
of their <em>darlings</em> were doubtless best qualified to fodder their <em>deers</em>.
He congratulated the Meeting, that while common show-men were
confined by their capabilities to merely exhibiting their animals alive,
this collection presented exclusively the additional advantage of a
speedy opportunity of dissection. He concluded by an announcement,
for which he trusted they would ever prove grateful, that his
Majesty had granted to the Society permission to appear at Court
with long ears and a tail, and to distinguish themselves by the appendage
of any letters not exceeding three to their names, but
ending with an S. At this intimation the delighted <em>Ear</em>-ers trotted
away to give orders to their <em>tail</em>-ers, and to search their dictionaries.
They all returned <em>suit</em>-ed before they got far into the alphabet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President then read an interesting letter from a member
detailing new facts in the history of the domestic cat (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felis communis</span></i>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>The writer's housekeeper had been making her annual
brewing of elder wine, which was left in the barrel, unstopped,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum artem</span></i>, to ferment. Hearing an extraordinary noise in
the cellar, she ventured to peep through the key-hole, and to her
consternation beheld about twenty strange cats, assembled, apparently
on the invitation of the Tortoise-shell of the family. They
were engaged in springing in succession on the barrel, plunging
their tails through the bung-hole into the delicious liquid till
saturated, and then sucking them dry. The old lady distinctly
heard her pet grimalkin say to a grave tabby gentleman, who seemed
tasting, with an air of connoisseurship, "How! How!" to which
he replied, in sounds which seemed to her very like "More brandy."
The worthy dame fell down in a swoon, and was found by some of
the servants in a state of insensibility, with an empty brandy bottle
in her hand, and she had only sufficiently recovered to narrate the
above remarkable occurrence. The letter was ordered to be published
in their Annual Report, and many other <em>tails</em> of cats formed
subjects of conversation during the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>A learned member offered a shrewd conjecture that the common
shrew was the connecting link between quadrupeds and a certain
variety of woman-kind, and that the universal chain might again
be traced from man to the feathered race, through the medium of
the human thief, especially when he was a-robbin!</p>

<p class='c000'>The secretary informed the society that in consequence of the
discoveries of the British Association, the giraffes had been lately
fed on lettuce leaves, which had so far imparted to their necks the
properties of caoutchouc, that they now possessed the capability of
indefinite extension. At this period of the proceedings one of the
animals stretched his neck from his stable to the council room, and
as the president was proceeding to offer some consolation on the
head of the dead lion, by descanting on the spur in his tail, put his
face into the midst of the company, and, for the first time in his
life, cried out, "Bah!" which had the effect of breaking up the
assembly.</p>

 <td class='blt tdv tdl' rowspan='41'><span class='sc'>Dear Dick</span>,—I copied my school letter to Father and
 Mother ten times before one was good enough, and while
 the teacher is putting the capitals and flourishes in I shall
 slip this off on the sly. Our examination was yesterday and
 the table was covered with books and things bound in gilt
 and silk for prizes but were all put away again and none of
 us got none only they awarded Master Key a new fourpenny
 bit for his essay on Locke because his friends live next door
 and little Coombe got the tooth-ake so they would not let
 him try his experiments on vital air which was very scurvy.
 It didnt come to my turn so I did not get a prize but as the
 company was to stop tea I put the cat in the water butt
 which they clean it out in the holidays and they will be sure
 to find her and we were all treated with tea and I did not
 like to refuse as they might have suspext something. Last
 night we had a stocking and bolster fight after we went to
 bed and I fougt a little lad with a big bolster his name is Bill
 Barnacle and I knocked his eye out with a stone in my
 stocking but no body knows who did it because we were all
 in the dark so I could not see no harm in it. Dear Dick
 send me directly your Wattses Hyms to show for I burnt
 mine and a lump of cobblers wax for the masters chair on
 breaking up day and some small shot to pepper the people
 with my quill gun and eighteen pence in coppers to shy at
 the windows as we ride through the villiage and make it one
 and ninepence for there's a good many as Ive a spite against
 yourself and meet me at the Elephant and Castle and if
 there's room on the coach you can get up for I want to give
 you some crackers to let off as soon as we get home while
 they are all a Kissing of me<br /><br />

<h3 class='c007'>SCRAPS FROM THE ANNUAL REGISTER.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jan. 9.</span>—At a general meeting of the Governors of Christ's Hospital, Sir
John Soane's splendid architectural design for a new gateway to the school
was adopted, with one dissentient only, to whom it was conceded, at his
special request, that his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> should be allowed to enter through a <em>Pipe
of Port</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Feb. 10.</span>—An eminent apothecary in the New Road attended at Marylebone
office to prosecute his errand boy, who, when sent out with medicine,
being versed in Shakspeare, used to "throw physic to the dogs," and sell the
empty bottles: the boy had spent the money in going to see the Bottle Imp.
The doctor said his suspicions were first excited by finding his patients suddenly
getting well. His worship at first threatened the culprit with the
pillory and the black-hole; but afterwards changed the sentence into pills
and a black draught, as more severe, and desired his master to take him home
and dose him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>March 10.</span>—A young lady at the Bucks county ball was apparently seized
with convulsions in the midst of a quadrille. Her mamma ran to her assistance,
and matters were soon restored. It seems that, her waist having been
reduced to the minimum of magnitude, she was always obliged to be unhooked
behind before she could sneeze.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>May 25.</span>—An elderly Gentleman was charged with having kissed a Lady
for a Lark, in the fields near Kentish Town. He was fined five shillings for
not being a better naturalist, with an admonition from the worthy magistrate,
that most of the birds in that district belonged to the order "Pass-er."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>June 23.</span>—The splendid pair of yahoos, recently presented to the So-oh!-logical
Society by the Duke of C——, have shown such extraordinary apt-ness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>under the influence of example and good society, that on Sunday last,
after having been submitted to the respective operations of Mr. Stulz and
Madame Carson, they were allowed to walk out among the fashionables, when
they deported themselves so well, that none but those in the secret could distinguish
them from the rest of the company.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>July 15.</span>—The torrents which ushered in the morning led many to believe
that, as this was the first day of St. Swithin's <em>reign</em>, so he had also selected
it for his coronation; and in this they were confirmed by the streaming of
the people along the streets, and the <em>wringing</em> of the <em>Belles</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Aug. 26.</span>—At the meeting of the British Association, at Bristol, Professor
Buckland announced, as an indisputable fact, that the antediluvians kept
cows, and vended their produce as we do; for, in the plains of Bul-garia,
he had recently discovered a petrified milk walk, with a fragment of a fossil
pump-handle at the end of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sept. 1.</span>—A sporting Cockney was unlucky enough to hit a cow in the
calf of her leg, at Hornsey. She was no sooner in a limp than he was in a
hobble, and he found to his cost that leg of beef is not always to be peppered
with impunity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sept. 12.</span>—Mr. Curtis announced his intention of standing for the Borough
of <em>Eye</em>, in the event of a dissolution of Parliament, and made his opening
speech to the voters amidst cries of "<em>Ear! Ear!</em>"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Oct. 10.</span>—"Found, a healthy male Infant," &amp;c., &amp;c. That ancient <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sine
quâ non</span></i> to persons crossing the seas, a child's <em>caul</em>, is now a mere drug in the
market. Instead of making it a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compagnon de voyage</span></i>, numbers cross the
seas to avoid it. A child's <em>call</em>, in high preservation, may be picked up on
any moonlight night, in any blind alley where you see "Rubbish to be shot
here." A handbill headed "Desertion," formerly a monstrosity of un-English
shape, is now a forme that the parish printer always keeps standing; and
the beadles dryly observe, that they are become wet nurses to the children of
half the parish. The Honourable Commissioners of the mechanical powers,
Messrs. Leave-er, Wedge, and Screw, are indefatigable in fulfilling the intentions
of their employers who have devised this happy state of things, to
save themselves and their hopeful heirs from the unpleasant necessity of
answering "A child's call."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Nov. 2.</span>—A resolution was carried in the Common Council not to allow
any more money for summer excursions on the water. The minority said
they dreaded the vengeance of the ladies, and many members returned
home in a very unhappy state, looking anxiously about for inscriptions of
"Broken crockery mended here;" for they knew, by past experience, that
man is the vessel that goes to pot when it comes to family jars.</p>

not arrive in a day or two, send again. By this exactness, you
give your tradesmen confidence, and ensure their civility for some
time, in the hope of a settlement. Having thus prevented any
increase of charges, you can pay at your leisure. I have heard of
a gentleman whose aversion to the sight of paper ruled in money
columns had been indulged in as long as was consistent with his
personal safety, who thus addressed a creditor for whom the <em>shut
sesame</em> of "call again" had lost its charm. "After having for
many years neglected my affairs, I have at length awakened to a
sense of my error, and have resolved, by a vigorous system of
economy, to retrieve them. Method, Sir, I now perceive that
method is everything. From this day I set apart a certain portion
of my income sacred to the payment of my debts."—"I am
delighted, Sir, to hear of your noble resolution."—"I have made
a schedule of all I owe, and shall begin at the top and persevere
undeviatingly in regular though slow succession towards the
bottom:—so that you see, my dear Mr. Figgins"—"Sir, my name
is Wiggins"—"Wiggins! I had quite forgot; but I am sorry to
hear it, very sorry—for my list is alphabetical. Had it been
Figgins, or even Higgins, there would have been some chance for
you, but the W's are so very low down.—No, I cannot say when
I shall reach the W's."</p>

<p class='c000'>If you wish to refuse the request of an old friend or a poor relation,
but can hardly screw your courage to the sticking-place, put
on a pair of tight shoes, and you will find it perfectly easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never introduce your friends to strangers without their consent,
nor permit such a liberty towards yourself, especially about November.
Many have been entrapped into the hands of John Doe
and Richard Roe thereby, unawares.</p>

<p class='c000'>Choose rainy days to pay your visits on. You will thus show
your sincerity, and be less likely to miss callers at home. Take
your cloak and hat into the drawing-room—to leave them below
would be like one of the family—but, above all, carry in your
umbrella; you have no right to leave it streaming in another
person's hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you visit your maiden aunt, as you value your legacy
expectant, preserve an amiable face, and keep you hands and feet
to yourself, while her favourite tom cat reposes in you the height of
his friendship by looking you full in the face and vigorously stretching
himself by the aid of his ten talons hooked through your tight
and tender kerseymeres.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Though you may be a Nabob, or as rich as one, be not too
anxious to parade your black servants before your friends, for both
your sakes; they have, in general, two bad qualities—"stealing
and giving odour."—Shakspeare, hem!</p>

<p class='c000'>Never marry a widow (unless her first husband was hanged), or
she will be always drawing unpleasant comparisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never refuse a pinch of snuff, but do not become a snuff-taker:
it is paying through the nose for a little pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Avoid argument with Ladies. In spinning a yarn among Silks
and Satins, a man is sure to be <em>Worsted</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is common to speak contemptuously of tailors and dress-makers.
This is bad taste; none but a rat would run down the
sewers.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a lady sits down to the pianoforte, always volunteer to
turn over the leaves. To be able to read music is of no consequence,
as you will know that she is at the bottom of a page when
she stops short. If you turn over two leaves at once, you will
probably have the secret thanks of most of the company.</p>

<p class='c000'>When your friend enters the room instantly rise, and, though
there may be half a dozen unoccupied chairs at hand, draw him
with gentle force into your own. You will thus show the warmth
of your friendship; for a damp seat may be as bad as a damp bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In driving out never make a lady treasurer of the turnpike
trusts;—or, when you want twopence for a toll, you have to wait
while the reticule string is snapped in two; then, out comes a
lace-edged white muslin worked pocket-handkerchief, a pair of
lemon-coloured kid-gloves, a smelling-bottle, a bunch of keys, and,
to crown all, a five-shilling piece to change. All this time you are
stuck fast in the jaws of a turnpike gate, the Brighton Quicksilver
in your rear, driver raving at your back, leaders snorting over your
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never plan a pic-nic, on pain of skulking about the town for six
months after, dreading to meet, at every turn, the infuriated looks
of the bereaved parents of half a dozen little innocents in white
frocks and trousers, who have been washed away by an inundation;
or to encounter the menacing glances of budding heroes, fierce in
the rudiments of moustaches and chin-tufts, whose Celias and
Delias have dropped into a decline through sitting on the damp
grass at your instigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never hesitate to take a friend with you when you go out to
dinner. Disappointments are so frequent that the lady of the
house may perhaps be glad of a spare gentleman to fill up a gap.</p>

<p class='c000'>In carving, remember that "'twere well it were done quickly."
He must be, therefore, the best carver who soonest fills the
greatest number of plates. Waste no time in asking if people
like a wing or a leg, this bit or that—many do not know their
minds on any subject. Besides, as they cannot all have the
prime cuts, nothing but discontent can ensue from giving them
the choice.</p>

<p class='c000'>As too much of a good thing is morally impossible, fill the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>plates well—the delicate can leave half, and the modest are
saved the unpleasantness of a second application; besides making
the hostess your eternal friend, if, through your management in
the outset, some of the dishes go away uncut for another day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Always return into the dish, before it goes from table, any
portion of a ragout that your friends may leave in their plates.
It is ten to one if your careless servants think of doing so afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of waiting for the dessert, let your children come in
with the first course—they cannot be used to good society too
soon. They will furnish topics for conversation, and if any present
be vulgar enough to require a second supply of soup, when the
tureen is at low water mark, they will probably relieve your
embarrassment by upsetting it, and so dispose of the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Help the darlings first—they are dearer to you than mere
visitors, to whom you might, otherwise, inadvertently transfer
some delicate bits on which the little cherubs had set their minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do not detain the toothpick long after dinner—it's unpleasant
to be kept waiting for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a lady request you to select an apple for her, bite a piece
out. How can you recommend it without?</p>

<p class='c000'>Always wipe the brim of a pot of porter with your sleeve, if
you are about to hand it to a lady.</p>

      <div class='line'>Oh, Charity! celestial <em>dame</em>!—I cannot call thee <em>maid</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>While ev'ry year thy children clear make such a grand parade.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! 'tis a glorious sight to see thy little pauper brats</div>
      <div class='line'>Parade the streets of <em>Baby</em>lon like demi-drowned rats.</div>
      <div class='line'>Before the sun's begun to run, they're startled from their nest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by their anxious mothers in the parish fin'ry dressed;</div>

      <div class='line'>Their offspring all so nicely clothed in that smart livery!</div>
      <div class='line'>The girls all clad in worsted gowns, mob caps, and aprons white,</div>

      <div class='line'>How proud it makes a Briton feel to view this glorious sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tho' some there are too dull to share the exquisite delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>I heard a surly cynic once thus vent his angry spleen,</div>

      <div class='line'>"If this be Christian Charity, who loves abroad to roam,</div>
      <div class='line'>"I wish, instead of coming here, that she had stay'd at home.</div>
      <div class='line'>"I'm sure she has no feeling for those wretched little dears,</div>
      <div class='line'>"Or she'd not make them into jam all in that place of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tiers</span></i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>"Whate'er Sir Robert Peel may say, or Tory folks may shout,</div>
      <div class='line'>"I'm sure the 'pressure' from within is worse than that 'without.'</div>
      <div class='line'>"But little girls may swoon away, and little boys may bawl,</div>
      <div class='line'>"None, in this age of intellect, now care for a <em>child's call</em>.</div>
      <div class='line'>"The cannibals, who eat up folks, have always made a point</div>
      <div class='line'>"To kill their two legg'd animals before they dress'd a joint;</div>
      <div class='line'>"But Christian anthropophagites possess a nicer goût,</div>
      <div class='line'>"And cook their flesh alive whene'er they make a human stew."</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus did he snarl and grumble at this glorious institution;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some enemy he must have been to Britain's constitution,</div>
      <div class='line'>For he who'd seek to work a change by pleading for humanity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must either be disloyal or the victim of insanity.</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>THAT MISTER NUBIBUS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Reader, <em>my</em> name's Nubibus. I am "that Romeo." My ruling
passion is a taste for the rurals. My love of green fields may be
almost termed a green sickness. You may talk of your ottomans
and your fauteuils, <em>I</em> never sit so easy as in a rustic chair. But,
unhappily, my pleasure is not without a damper. The rain is my
most mortal foe: my skies are always cloudy: my trees are continually
on the drip: my Pan is always a Watering Pan. At the
moment of my birth, even, it was observed that the watchman was
going his rounds and crying, "Past four o'clock, and a rainy morning:"
and many of my best friends think it likely that my last days
will be accompanied by a drop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Last Friday was a notable instance of my unluck. The morning
was most beautiful—sun shining, birds singing, weather-glass down
at <em>Stormy</em>, and Moore's Almanack at <em>Heavy Rain</em>—everything, in
short, promised a fine day; and I immediately dressed myself in my
most summery attire, and set off to join Mrs. Timon Duggins's pic-nic
party to Battersea Fields. I found all the company already
assembled in her little parlour, in Greek Street, Soho, and I could
hear them greet my arrival with, "Oh! here's <em>that</em> Mr. Nubibus!
we're sure to have rain if he comes." However, I took no notice of
their impertinences, but calmly brushed the dust off my gossamer
pumps, to show that I had no fear on my own account: tho', sooth
to say, I had taken care not to come without my old friend, my
walking-stick umbrella. Well, off we set, took boat at Hungerford
Stairs, and reached our place of destination without misadventure.
Miss Arabella Dix was the first lady to land, which she did by stepping
into a squashy place among the rushes, from which she came
out with an abundant supply of mud and water, and not without
an angry look at me, as much as to say, "Ay, it's all thro' <em>that</em> Mr.
Nubibus!" But this was not the worst. Gallantry forbade that
Miss Arabella should remain in her unfortunate dampness while
there were so many dry gentlemen in company: and, as it unluckily
turned out that mine was the only small foot of the party, I was
obliged to give up my dry pumps to Miss Arabella; tho' I own it
went to my very <em>sole</em> to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh! how I <em>do</em> love the country!" exclaimed Miss Arabella, as
soon as she had established herself in my dry shoes; "the sky, the
water, the trees, how delightful!" I felt as if I could have hugged
her. My taste to a T.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And there! there's a spectacle! that lovely <em>rainbow</em>!" I felt
as if I could have committed homicide upon the provoking creature,
and clenched my walking-stick umbrella with the force of a maniac.
On came the rainbow; clap went the thunder; down poured the
rain—cats and dogs, puppies and <em>kitlings</em>. All eyes were turned
upon me reproachfully. Up went umbrellas and parasols; out came
cloaks and Mackintoshes. An air of triumph seemed to pervade
the company as they remarked that there were no means of shelter
left for me. I let them enjoy their triumph for a while, and then I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>quietly unscrewed the top of my walking-stick umbrella. My
walking-stick umbrella, did I say? Alas! I had brought my bamboo
telescope instead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Ariel Hicks, a young gentleman of fifteen years of age,
and as many stones weight, now offered me a share of his parapluie;
but, as Hicks was only four feet two inches in height, and I stood
five feet ten in my shoes (or rather, in Miss Arabella's), I was soon
tired of doing penance in the form of a letter S, and boldly declared
my utter contempt for all kinds of showers, and thunder-showers
in particular. What made our situation still more provoking, was
the presence of an opposition pic-nic party in the adjoining field,
cosily enjoying themselves under a waterproof tent, from the entrance
of which a grinning face would every now and then peep out,
evidently in high glee at our miserable appearance. The weather
getting clear, it was proposed to have a ramble among the green
trees: but the Dryads and Hamadryads turning out to be anything
but what their name imported, we were glad to escape from their
dripping bowers with all possible speed. Hungry as wolves, and
shivering with cold, we now addressed ourselves to Mrs. Timon
Duggins, who had undertaken to be purveyor to the whole party.
Mrs. Timon Duggins was as hungry as we. But where was "Mr.
Gunterses young man?—Mr. Gunterses young man, that she (Mrs.
D.) had ordered to be on the ground punctually at two o'clock?"
Echo, and several of the young ladies and gentlemen answered
"Where?" But still Mr. Gunter's young man appeared not. At
last Mrs. Timon Duggins, employing one end of her spectacles as
an eye-glass, exclaimed, "Why, there he is!" and there, sure enough,
we saw him, standing with his baskets on his arm, watching the
departure of the rival party, who were merrily sailing down the
river to the tune of the Canadian Boat Song, sung by the whole
strength of the company. The young jackal was soon summoned,
and bid to spread the repast: but what was our horror on learning
that he had mistaken the rival party for ours, and suffered them to
eat up all our provisions. Half dead with cold and hunger, we
turned the baskets inside out: but nothing was left except a few
ices and a bottle or two of ginger-beer!</p>

<p class='c000'>By great good fortune one of the Twickenham steamers was just
then going by, and as Ariel Hicks, who was an amateur sailor, had
some acquaintance with the skipper, he succeeded in procuring us
some prog from the vessel. We had scarcely got our knives and
forks well fixed in it, however, when the rain again began to fall in
torrents, and we were glad to get away to our boats and Mackintoshes.
Our voyage home was not less disastrous. The boat had
been filled to about ankle deep by the late heavy rains, and we were
obliged to sit all the way with our feet held up above high-water
mark—except those who thought proper to put them in the wet <em>by
way of relief</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning there was but one answer to all inquiries—"Our
compliments, and we're very ill in bed of colds and rheumatisms;
and it's all owing to <em>that</em> Mister Nubibus."</p>

tour; but, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hélas!</span></i> if you expect it has been a happy one, you <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trompez</span></i> yourself
most sadly. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon dieu!</span></i> the sufferings we have undergone! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais voilà</span></i> the
journal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span class='sc'>Monday, Sept. 1.</span>—Embarked on board the "Emerald" steamer at London
Bridge for Boulogne, at one o'clock in the morning, after having passed a
miserable night in packing up, and trying to go to sleep in easy chairs. Pa
complaining of symptoms of lumbago.—All the berths taken, mostly by gentlemen—or
rather, by monsters in the form of gentlemen. <em>Mon dieu!</em> what brutes
the English men are! to suffer us poor helpless <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femelles</span></i> to pass the night on
deck, while they are snoring away comfortably in the cabins! Ma's blue silk
pelisse was soon put <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i> by the nasty tar and stuff, and my new
French-white bonnet was turned into a regular London smoke in ten minutes
by the horrid chimney.—Ma has made the acquaintance of a very nice <em>Dame
Française</em>, who speaks pretty good English, and abounds in anecdotes about
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande nation</span></i>. Also, has kindly taken charge of one of Ma's <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sacs de nuit</span></i>; as
she says the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span></i> won't allow people to land more than one carpet-bag
a-piece, and Ma not choosing to leave her valuables at the mercy of those
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vilains bêtes</span></i>, the custom-house officers. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moi aussi, j'ai fait connaissance</span></i> with a
charming fellow, the <em>Marquís de Mandeville</em>, a young <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">militaire</span></i>, in black
moustaches and a green foraging cap.—Marquis beginning to make himself very
agreeable; in fact, becoming quite <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amoureux</span></i>, when both taken suddenly ill, and
obliged to part. Ah! Adelaide dear! it's a sad change, from love-sick to sea-sick!
French lady very kind, and asked me if I had the <em>mal de mere</em>—thought
she meant "my mother's complaint," which you know is rheumatism in
the hips—answered accordingly, and got horribly laughed at by a lot of rude
fellows in make-believe sailors' jackets.—Ma next attacked—Pa next—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout le
monde</span></i> soon in the same plight. Sensation dreadful—headache worse and worse—Ma
wanted to be set down at Dover, but Captain wouldn't hear of it. French
lady very attentive—<em>would</em> fetch tumblers of brandy and water for Pa and Ma
and me—couldn't drink a drop—<em>she</em> did, and wasn't sick at all. Obliged to stop
my journal—so very ill.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span class='sc'>Tuesday</span>, <em>Boulogne</em>—Landed here half dead, having lost the tide, and obliged
to pass another night at sea. All very ill. Pa's lumbago confirmed, and Ma's
rheumatism <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">très mal</span></i>.—Unable to go to Paris; and our places having been paid
for all the way, obliged to forfeit the money; Pa very cross, Ma very uncomfortable.
<span class='sc'>5 o'Clock, p.m.</span>—Pa has just been in to say that the French lady
refuses to give up Ma's <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sac de nuit</span></i>, containing all her valuables; and that, as it
was landed in her name, there's no remedy.—A call from Marquis—advises us
not to make a rumpus about it, for fear of being taken up as smugglers. His
lordship's valet not being yet arrived, under the unpleasant necessity of borrowing
five pounds of Pa. Pa very suspicious, until Marquis showed us his passport,
where they have taken him two black eyes, a nose <em>aquilin</em>, black <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux</span></i>,
and five feet three inches of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">taille</span></i>. Only think, Adelaide dear! what a picture
of a lover!</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span class='sc'>Wednesday.</span>—Passed a dreadful night, not having been able to sleep a
wink for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">punaises</span></i>. Ma bit all over, and her face as big as two. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moi aussi</span></i>,
my eyes completely swelled up, all but one little corner, just enough to see what
a fright I am in the looking-glass. Unable to get any assistance from the
people at the inn, our <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manuel du voyageur</span></i> not containing any dialogue between
a chambermaid and a lady bitten by bugs; and Pauline, Ma's maid, that she
hired by advertisement, having left us the moment we landed, her only motive
in engaging herself at all being to get her passage paid back to her native
country.—Can't get anything that we can eat at the inn, and reduced to sea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>biscuits and water. I have again tried to make our wants known to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fille de
chambre</span></i>, but without success, they <em>do</em> speak such very bad French in the
provinces—quite a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i>, in fact. Hope we shall do better in Paris.—Marquis
called, and recommended Pa to hire a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de place</span></i>. Kindly undertook to provide
him one, who speaks French and English, and understands the horrible
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i> of the Boulognese. This will take a good deal off my hands, who am
obliged to be <em>interpreteur</em> to the whole party.—<em>Alexis</em>, the new <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de place</span></i>,
arrives.—Got something eatable at last, and are to start for Paris <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demain matin</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span class='sc'>Thursday.</span>—Up at five. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Déjeûner</span></i>, and start for Paris at seven—Marquis
in same <em>diligence</em>. Weather dreadfully hot. Rival diligence got the start, and
<em>will</em> keep before us all day, the French laws not allowing one coach to pass
another. Dust dreadful—and worse for us than any of the rest, as we had
taken our seats in front of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiture</span></i>, for the sake of seeing the country—and,
after all, no country to see. Proposed to some <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilhommes</span></i> inside to change
places with Ma and me; but met with a flat refusal. Begin to think French
gentlemen are not much more <em>poli</em> than English ones.—Dined at Abbeville, and
arrived at Amiens late at night, very tired and ill.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span class='sc'>Friday.</span>—Up at five, after a sleepless night. Started at seven. Heat
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme hier</span></i>—dust <em>ditto</em>: <em>two</em> diligences before us.—Dined, or rather <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d'hôte'd</span></i>
(which is a very different thing) at Clermont. Didn't eat an ounce all three of
us, but obliged to pay five francs a-piece for our dinners—and, as we had no
francs left, the people kindly consented to take English shillings instead.—Ma
and I quite ill, from heat, and dust, and fasting, and one thing or another; and
Pa's lumbago much worse since the heavy thunderstorm which soaked thro'
his waterproof hat, and ran off his Mackintosh into his shoes, till they were all
of a squash.—Seeing our distress, three French gentlemen inside kindly consented
to relinquish their seats in our favour, an offer which we gladly accepted.
The French are really polite, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">après tout!</span></i>—<span class='sc'>10 o'Clock,</span> <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la nuit!</span></i>—Arrived in
Paris at the <em>Hotel de Lyon</em>, the Marquis very politely handing us out, and seeing
us to our room.—Rather annoyed by Pa's coming in and kicking up a rumpus
about the gentlemen who had taken our paid places on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première banquette</span></i>,
and who had left him to pay for the three insides all the way from Boulogne.—Marquis
very <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aimable</span></i>, and gave us all a pressing invitation to pay him a visit
at his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span></i> in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vendée</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span class='sc'>Saturday.</span>—The Marquis to breakfast.—With his Lordship to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin
des Plantes</span></i>, where we had no sooner arrived among the lions and tigers than it
began to rain cats and dogs. The noble Marquis very kind in holding the
umbrella over him and me, and sending Pa to call a coach at the neighbouring
coach-stand. Pa <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">très long-tems</span></i> away—at last saw him coming along in the
custody of two <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gend'armes</span></i>, covered with mud and dirt, and bleeding profusely.
Learned that poor Pa, instead of calling '<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</span></i>,' as he ought to have done,
had called the man '<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</span></i>,' which, you know, means 'pig;' at which the
coachman at first laughed; but Pa persisting in calling him '<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</span></i>,' he at
last got down in a rage, and attacked Pa most furiously. I am sorry to say, poor
Pa got <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terriblement maltraité</span></i>. Ma has been in fits ever since, and Pa won't be
able to go out for weeks. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour moi</span></i>, I am as ill as any one can be—nothing but
the Marquis's kindness keeps me alive...."</p>

to hear for as we have left off our cups we have less need of the balls, but I am
sorey to sea all our happytites is sadly hincreased witch is wery detrimental and
hilconvenent at this critearyon of the ear. We was extorted last weakly
meeting by a new member a norrid drunkerd but now quite a reform carrikter
sins his money was all gone and nobody wont trust him. His discoors
was quite headyfying for he is a tailer and goos about in the good cawse since
he left off gozzling. Before he jined us he was alwise stupid drunk and
beatin his wif and now he never gives his mind to licker. Just at the beginning
he was quite affecting and could not get on without a go of brandy
which we thought very rum. He as given up his trade witch was his sole
dependanse sinse he lost all his plaices and know dout he will be trew to us

we are getting quite hammerous of our tease witch at first was very

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The approaching vacation devolves on me the pleasing duty of reporting
to you, by the hands of Master Timothy, the general progress of his studies.
In some respects his extraordinary precocity has even exceeded my wishes. I
have directed his reading principally to Biography, and his ardour has led
him to add to my selection the lives of Turpin and Moore Carew, together
with the instructive narratives of the Newgate Calendar. His progress in
penmanship has been so great, that he has not only written all his own letters,
but many for his school-fellows, to which the versatility of his genius has led
him to append their names so accurately, as to enable him to obtain from
their parents, with the help of the post-boy, a considerable addition to his
pocket-money. I have cleared up a few of these little shades of character,
which have been brought to light, as you will perceive at the foot of my bill.
In Arithmetic, Subtraction has been his favourite rule, as all the drawers in
the house can testify. He has also worked some complicated sums in Vulgar
Fractions, and proved them, by the glazier's bill enclosed. His skill in Division
has also been displayed in his setting all the school together by the ears.
In Composition, his forte is romance and general fiction; indeed his conversation
is of so flowery a nature, as to have been compared to a wreath of
li-lies. At our races he greatly improved his acquaintance with the Greeks—Late-in,
of course, included—and my servants picked him up at midnight,
land-measuring, at length, on the Turnpike road. He has progressed in
Logic, though rather addicted to strange premises, which may lead to serious
conclusions. He has become an accomplished natural philosopher—his pursuit
of Ornithology has led him to every hen-roost in the village, and all my
eggs have been constantly exhausted in his experiments on suction. During
his inquiries into the nature of animal heat, my favourite cat caught a severe
cold, from which she never recovered, through his turning her out without
her skin, on a frosty night. I have inserted a small item from my surgeon's
bill, for repairs of his companions' noses, damaged by his passion for Conchology;
and a charge, which I fear you will think heavy, for a skylight, destroyed
by Master Timothy's falling through, while crawling along the parapet
on a dark night, to seek some information at my gardener's daughter's
window—an extraordinary instance of the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties.
His decided turn for the belles lettres has deprived me of two of my
best maids; for I have been obliged to discharge them on suspicion of irregularly
participating in his studies, contrary to the rules of my establishment.
As I do not feel competent, however, to do justice to the education of so
talented a youth, I shall not expect to see Master Timothy again after the
holidays.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How provoking! such a choking, thick, and yellow fog</div>
      <div class='line'>No Turk or Jew would venture to turn out a Christian dog.</div>
      <div class='line'>'Tis cruel hard, upon my word, with such a gloomy sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>To quit my down for Queen or crown, it looks so winter-lye.</div>
      <div class='line'>I'd rather keep me warm within, than go in all this rout,</div>
      <div class='line'>For it's not my creed, except in need, to take to "cold without."</div>
      <div class='line'>And I cannot see why this should be, nor the reason of it all,</div>
      <div class='line'>It's quite a job to dine with Bob and Nabob in Guildhall.</div>
      <div class='line'>—"Why, don't you see, her Majesty as yet is but a green one,</div>
      <div class='line'>She's heard of city riots, but by chance has never seen one;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tho' a king of the land once fear'd the Strand, and said it was full of sinners,</div>
      <div class='line'>And through Cheapside was afraid to ride, so they went without their dinners.</div>
      <div class='line'>But see the light is getting bright, and the streets are filled with people,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pennons gleam, in the morning beam, from turret and from steeple.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sound that swells from St. Martin's bells would please O'Connell's ear,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the Union flag does gaily wag, they're all re-pealers there.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now the crush becomes a rush, and the Black and Red Guards fright beholders,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here comes the Lancers, they're the prancers, and the Blues with their broad swords over their shoulders.</div>
      <div class='line'>And Temple Bar is the seat of war, and rags the ground bestrew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here's a Sunday hat, and a boy squeezed flat, a purse and a satin shoe.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mister soldier! of course you'll make your horse take his foot from off my toe.</div>
      <div class='line'>I'm on duty, sir, and I dare not stir till I hear the trumpet blow.—</div>
      <div class='line'>But we've paid our guineas, and we're not such ninnies as to stand in all this riot,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Here's a lady dead, for she hangs her head, and seems so very quiet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! what a jam, we can scarcely cram our heads within the door;</div>
      <div class='line'>I fear you'll find, you must sit behind, since you did not come before.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! that won't do—we've paid for two—myself, and here's my cousin;</div>
      <div class='line'>I'm number twenty—here's room in plenty—why, your window wont hold a dozen.</div>
      <div class='line'>'Tis a swindling cheat, but we lose the treat while haggling here we stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we'll not submit to be thus bit, if a lawyer's in the land.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now stand fast, they come at last, the grooms in their cloth of gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Royal Dukes, you may know by their looks, so thick they can scarce be told.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here are Silver Sticks, in a coach-and-six, methinks it's rather funny,</div>
      <div class='line'>But those sticks are dear, and it's very clear they cost a deal of money.</div>
      <div class='line'>A coach to carry a stick, indeed, how comical you talk—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! there's many a stick, with head so thick, that rides when he ought to walk.</div>
      <div class='line'>But who is that, in the feathers and hat, so gracious she nods her head,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, that's the Queen's Bed-chamber maid. Is her Majesty going to bed?</div>
      <div class='line'>Now the best of the fun is just begun, for, prancing, may be seen</div>
      <div class='line'>The handsome Common Council men, in their gowns of mazarine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Sheriffs bold, in their chains of gold, and not disposed to quarrel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though one the song of <em>Moses</em> sings, and the other a Christmas <em>Carroll</em>.</div>
      <div class='line'>And each Alderman fat, in his three cock'd hat—so comely, one by one</div>
      <div class='line'>They stately ride, with their grooms beside—no doubt, to hold them on.</div>
      <div class='line'>'Tis the Mayor, of course, outside a horse, with the sword of state before him,</div>
      <div class='line'>He looks, in his pride, from side to side. How the 'prentice boys adore him!</div>
      <div class='line'>Hurrah! Hurrah! she comes this way—stand firm to see her pass!</div>
      <div class='line'>Well, what have you seen?—why, not the Queen, but the glare of the window glass.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, I'm going wild! have you seen my child? from above I let him fall.—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes, there he rolls on the people's polls, and he'll soon be at Guildhall.</div>
      <div class='line'>That little crowd, they scream so loud, it pierces thro' and thro' you;</div>
      <div class='line'>It's all the charity girls and boys a-singing "Hallelujah,"</div>
      <div class='line'>And "Live the Queen"—'tis a lovely scene—did you hear that cracking note?—</div>
      <div class='line'>'Tis a little lass, in the second class, she's burst her little throat.</div>
      <div class='line'>And now the bells ring round again, and the cannon loudly thunder,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, before we go, do any know which <em>was</em> the Queen, I wonder?</div>
      <div class='line'><em>I</em> saw the Queen, she was dressed in green, and a gold tiara crown'd her.</div>
      <div class='line'>No, I rather think, that was her in pink, with the silver all around her.—</div>
      <div class='line'>In pink or green she never was seen, but she wore a robe of red,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she rode a horse, as a thing of course, with a fur cap on her head.—</div>
      <div class='line'>I think it's plain we shall know her again, so now we'll quit our station,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we'll take a turn, when the gas-lights burn, to see the illumination.</div>
      <div class='line'>See crowns and stars, and bright V.R.'s, and wreaths and garlands pretty,</div>
      <div class='line'>And laurels green all round the Queen, and mottoes quaint and witty.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Here's "Wax and Wick-toria" (<em>Cowan, in gloria</em>), "May she long wear her

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>JANUARY.—<span class='sc'>The Birth of the Year.</span></h3>

<p class='c016'>Some poet has observed, that if any man would write down what has really happened
to him in this mortal life, he would be sure to make a good book, though
he never had met with a single adventure from his birth to his burial; how much
more, then, must I, who <em>have</em> had adventures, most singular, pathetic, and unparalleled,
be able to compile an instructive and entertaining volume for the use
of the public!</p>

<p class='c000'>I don't mean to say that I have killed lions, or seen the wonders of travel in
the deserts of Arabia or Prussia: or that I have been a very fashionable character,
living with dukes and peeresses, and writing my recollections of them as the way
now is. I never left this my native isle, nor spoke to a lord (except an Irish one,
who had rooms in our house, and forgot to pay three weeks' lodging and extras);
but, as our immortal bard observes, I have in the course of my existence been so
eaten up by the slugs and harrows of outrageous fortune, and have been the
object of such continual and extraordinary ill-luck, that I believe it would melt
the heart of a mile-stone to read of it—that is, if a mile-stone had a heart of anything
but stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twelve of my adventures, suitable for meditation and perusal during the
twelve months of the year, have been arranged by me for this Almanack. They
contain a part of the history of a great, and, confidently I may say, a <em>good</em> man.
I was not a spendthrift like other men. I never wronged any man of a shilling,
though I am as sharp a fellow at a bargain as any in Europe. I never injured a
fellow-creature; on the contrary, on several occasions, when injured myself, have
shown the most wonderful forbearance. I come of a tolerably good family; and
yet, born to wealth—of an inoffensive disposition, careful of the money that I
had, and eager to get more, I have been going down hill ever since my journey of
life began, and have been pursued by a complication of misfortunes such as surely
never happened to any man but the unhappy Bob Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob Stubbs is my name; and I haven't got a shilling: I have borne the commission
of lieutenant in the service of King George, and am <em>now</em>—but never
mind what I am now, for the public will know in a few pages more. My father
was of the Suffolk Stubbses—a well-to-do gentleman of Bungay. My grandfather
had been a respected attorney in that town, and left my papa a pretty little
fortune. I was thus the inheritor of competence, and ought to be at this moment
a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c000'>My misfortunes may be said to have commenced about a year before my birth,
when my papa, a young fellow pretending to study the law in London, fell madly
in love with Miss Smith, the daughter of a tradesman, who did not give her a
sixpence, and afterwards became bankrupt. My papa married this Miss Smith
and carried her off to the country, where I was born, in an evil hour for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were I to attempt to describe my early years, you would laugh at me as an
impostor; but the following letter from mamma to a friend after her marriage,
will pretty well show you what a poor foolish creature she was; and what a reckless
extravagant fellow was my other unfortunate parent.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>To Miss Eliza Hicks, in Gracechurch Street, London.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>O Eliza! your Susan is the happiest girl under heaven! My Thomas is an
angel! not a tall grenadier-like looking fellow, such as I always vowed I would
marry:—on the contrary, he is what the world would call dumpy, and I hesitate
not to confess that his eyes have a cast in them. But what then? when one of
his eyes is fixed on me, and one on my babe, they are lighted up with an affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>which my pen cannot describe, and which, certainly, was never bestowed upon
any woman so strongly as upon your happy Susan Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he comes home from shooting, or the farm, if you <em>could</em> see dear Thomas
with me and our dear little Bob! as I sit on one knee, and baby on the other, and
as he dances us both about. I often wish that we had Sir Joshua, or some great
painter, to depict the group; for sure it is the prettiest picture in the whole world,
to see three such loving merry people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dear baby is the most lovely little creature that <em>can possibly be</em>,—the very <em>image</em>
of papa; he is cutting his teeth, and the delight of <em>everybody</em>. Nurse says, that
when he is older, he will get rid of his squint, and his hair will get a <em>great deal</em>
less red. Doctor Bates is as kind, and skilful, and attentive as we could desire.
Think what a blessing to have had him! Ever since poor baby's birth, it has never
had a day of quiet; and he has been obliged to give it from three to four doses
every week;—how thankful ought we to be that the <em>dear thing</em> is as well as it is!
It got through the measles wonderfully; then it had a little rash; and then a
nasty hooping cough; and then a fever, and continual pains in its poor little
stomach, crying, poor dear child, from morning till night.</p>

<p class='c000'>But dear Tom is an excellent nurse; and many and many a night has he had no
sleep, dear man! in consequence of the poor little baby. He walks up and down
with it <em>for hours</em>, singing a kind of song (dear fellow, he has no more voice than
a tea-kettle), and bobbing his head backwards and forwards, and looking, in his
night-cap and dressing-gown, <em>so droll</em>. Oh, Eliza! how you would laugh to see him.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have one of the best nursemaids <em>in the world</em>,—an Irishwoman, who is as
fond of baby almost as his mother (but that can <em>never be</em>). She takes it to walk in
the Park for hours together, and I really don't know why Thomas dislikes her. He
says she is tipsy very often, and slovenly, which I cannot conceive;—to be sure,
the nurse is sadly dirty, and sometimes smells very strong of gin.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what of that? These little drawbacks only make home more pleasant.
When one thinks how many mothers have no nursemaids; how many poor dear
children have no doctors: ought we not to be thankful for Mary Malowney, and
that Dr. Bates's bill is forty-seven pounds? How ill must dear baby have been,
to require so much physic!</p>

<p class='c000'>But they are a sad expense, these dear babies, after all. Fancy, Eliza, how much
this Mary Malowney costs us. Ten shillings every week; a glass of brandy or
gin at dinner, three pint bottles of Mr. Thrale's best porter every day,—making
twenty-one in a week; and nine hundred and ninety in the eleven months she
has been with us. Then, for baby, there is Dr. Bates's bill of forty-five guineas,
two guineas for christening, twenty for a grand christening supper and ball (rich
Uncle John mortally offended because he was made godfather, and had to give baby a
silver cup: he has struck Thomas out of his will; and old Mr. Firkin quite as much
hurt because he was <em>not</em> asked: he will not speak to me or John in consequence);
twenty guineas for flannels, laces, little gowns, caps, napkins, and such baby's ware:
and all this out of £300 a year! But Thomas expects to make <em>a great deal</em> by
his farm.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have got the most charming country-house <em>you can imagine</em>; it is <em>quite shut
in</em> by trees, and so retired that, though only thirty miles from London, the post
comes to us but once a week. The roads, it must be confessed, are execrable: it
is winter now, and we are up to our knees in mud and snow. But oh, Eliza! how
happy we are: with Thomas (he has had a sad attack of rheumatism, dear man!)
and little Bobby, and our kind friend Dr. Bates, who comes so far to see us, I leave
you to fancy that we have a charming merry party, and do not care for all the
gaieties of Ranelagh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adieu! dear baby is crying for his mamma: a thousand kisses from your
affectionate</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>FEBRUARY.—<span class='sc'>Cutting Weather.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I have called this chapter "cutting weather," partly in compliment to the month
of February, and partly in respect of my own misfortunes which you are going
to read about, for I have often thought that January (which is mostly twelfth cake
and holiday time) is like the first four or five years of a little boy's life; then
comes dismal February, and the working days with it, when chaps begin to look
out for themselves, after the Christmas and the New Year's hey-day and merry-making
are over, which our infancy may well be said to be. Well can I recollect
that bitter first of February, when I first launched out into the world and appeared
at Dr. Swishtail's academy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I began at school that life of prudence and economy, which I have carried on
ever since. My mother gave me eighteen-pence on setting out (poor soul! I
thought her heart would break as she kissed me, and bade God bless me); and besides,
I had a small capital of my own, which I had amassed for a year previous.
I'll tell you what I used to do. Wherever I saw six half-pence I took one. If it
was asked for, I said I had taken it, and gave it back;—if it was not missed, I
said nothing about it, as why should I?—those who don't miss their money don't
lose their money. So I had a little private fortune of three shillings, besides
mother's eighteen-pence. At school they called me the copper-merchant, I had
such lots of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, even at a preparatory school, a well-regulated boy may better himself: and
I can tell you I did. I never was in any quarrels: I never was very high in the
class or very low; but there was no chap so much respected: and why? <em>I'd always
money.</em> The other boys spent all their's in the first day or two, and they gave me
plenty of cakes and barley-sugar then, I can tell you. I'd no need to spend my
own money, for they would insist upon treating me. Well, in a week, when their's
was gone, and they had but their threepence a week to look to for the rest of the
half-year, what did I do? Why, I am proud to say that three-halfpence out of
the threepence a week of almost all the young gentlemen at Dr. Swishtail's, came
into my pocket. Suppose, for instance, Tom Hicks wanted a slice of gingerbread,
who had the money? Little Bob Stubbs to be sure. "Hicks," I used to say,
"<em>I'll</em> buy you three-halfp'orth of gingerbread, if you'll give me threepence next
Saturday:" and he agreed, and next Saturday came, and he very often could not
pay me more than three-halfpence, then there was the threepence I was to have <em>the
next</em> Saturday. I'll tell you what I did for a whole half-year:—I lent a chap by
the name of Dick Bunting three-halfpence the first Saturday, for threepence the
next; he could not pay me more than half when Saturday came, and I'm blest if I
did not make him pay me three-halfpence <em>for three and twenty weeks running</em>,
making two shillings and tenpence-halfpenny. But he was a sad dishonourable
fellow, Dick Bunting; for, after I'd been so kind to him, and let him off for
three-and-twenty weeks the money he owed me, holidays came, and threepence he
owed me still. Well, according to the common principles of practice, after six
weeks' holidays, he ought to have paid me exactly sixteen shillings, which was my
due. For the</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing could be more just; and yet, will it be believed? when Bunting came
back, he offered me <em>three-halfpence</em>! the mean, dishonest scoundrel!</p>

<p class='c000'>However, I was even with him, I can tell you.—He spent all his money in a
fortnight, and <em>then</em> I screwed him down! I made him, besides giving me a penny
for a penny, pay me a quarter of his bread and butter at breakfast, and a quarter of
his cheese at supper; and before the half-year was out, I got from him a silver
fruit knife, a box of compasses, and a very pretty silver-laced waistcoat, in which I
went home as proud as a king: and, what's more, I had no less than three golden
guineas in the pocket of it, besides fifteen shillings, the knife, and a brass bottle-screw,
which I got from another chap. It wasn't bad interest for twelve shillings,
which was all the money I'd had in the year, was it? Heigh ho! I've often wished
that I could get such a chance again in this wicked world; but men are more avaricious
now than they used to be in those early days.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/i_281_full.jpg'><img src='images/i_281.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Well, I went home in my new waistcoat as fine as a peacock; and when I gave
the bottle-screw to my father, begging him to take it as a token of my affection for
him, my dear mother burst into such a fit of tears as I never saw, and kissed and
hugged me fit to smother me. "Bless him, bless him," says she, "to think of his
old father! And where did you purchase it, Bob?"—"Why, mother," says I, "I
purchased it out of my savings" (which was as true as the gospel).—When I said
this, mother looked round to father, smiling, although she had tears in her eyes,
and she took his hand, and with her other hand drew me to her. "Is he not a
noble boy?" says she to my father: "and only nine years old!" "Faith!" says
my father, "he <em>is</em> a good lad, Susan. Thank thee, my boy: and here is a crown
piece in return for thy bottle-screw;—it shall open us a bottle of the very best, too,"
says my father; and he kept his word. I always was fond of good wine (though
never, from a motive of proper self-denial, having any in my cellar); and, by Jupiter!
on this night I had my little skin full,—for there was no stinting—so pleased were
my dear parents with the bottle-screw.—The best of it was, it only cost me threepence
originally, which a chap could not pay me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing this game was such a good one, I became very generous towards my parents:
and a capital way it is to encourage liberality in children. I gave mamma
a very neat brass thimble, and she gave me a half-guinea piece. Then I gave her
a very pretty needle-book, which I made myself with an ace of spades from a new
pack of cards we had, and I got Sally, our maid, to cover it with a bit of pink satin
her mistress had given her; and I made the leaves of the book, which I vandyked
very nicely, out of a piece of flannel I had had round my neck for a sore throat. It
smelt a little of hartshorn, but it was a beautiful needle-book, and mamma was so
delighted with it, that she went into town, and bought me a gold-laced hat. Then
I bought papa a pretty china tobacco-stopper; but I am sorry to say of my dear
father that he was not so generous as my mamma or myself, for he only burst out
laughing, and did not give me so much as a half-crown piece, which was the least
I expected from him "I shan't give you anything, Bob, this time," says he; "and
I wish, my boy, you would not make any more such presents,—for, really, they are
too expensive." Expensive, indeed! I hate meanness,—even in a father.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must tell you about the silver-edged waistcoat which Bunting gave me. Mamma
asked me about it, and I told her the truth,—that it was a present from one of the
boys for my kindness to him. Well, what does she do but writes back to Dr. Swishtail,
when I went to school, thanking him for his attention to her dear son, and
sending a shilling to the good and grateful little boy who had given me the waistcoat!</p>

<p class='c000'>"What waistcoat is it?" said the Doctor to me, "and who gave it you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bunting gave it me, sir," says I.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Call Bunting:" and up the little ungrateful chap came. Would you believe it?
he burst into tears,—told that the waistcoat had been given him by his mother, and
that he had been forced to give it for a debt to Copper Merchant, as the nasty little
blackguard called me. He then said, how, for three-halfpence, he had been compelled
to pay me three shillings (the sneak! as if he had been <em>obliged</em> to borrow
the three-halfpence!)—how all the other boys had been swindled (swindled!) by
me in like manner,—and how, with only twelve shillings, I had managed to scrape
together four guineas.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>My courage almost fails as I describe the shameful scene that followed. The
boys were called in, my own little account-book was dragged out of my cupboard, to
prove how much I had received from each, and every farthing of my money was
paid back to them. The tyrant took the thirty shillings that my dear parents had
given me, and said that he should put them into the poor-box at church; and, after
having made a long discourse to the boys about meanness and usury, he said, "Take
off your coat, Mr. Stubbs, and restore Bunting his waistcoat." I did, and stood
without coat and waistcoat in the midst of the nasty, grinning boys. I was going
to put on my coat,—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stop," says he, "TAKE DOWN HIS BREECHES!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Ruthless, brutal villain! Sam Hopkins, the biggest boy, took them down—horsed
me—and <em>I was flogged, sir</em>; yes, flogged! Oh, revenge! I, Robert Stubbs,
who had done nothing but what was right, was brutally flogged at ten years of age.—Though
February was the shortest month, I remembered it long.</p>

<p class='c016'>When my mamma heard of the treatment of her darling she was for bringing
an action against the schoolmaster, or else for tearing his eyes out (when, dear
soul! she would not have torn the eyes out of a flea, had it been her own injury),
and, at the very least, for having me removed from the school where I had been
so shamefully treated. But papa was stern for once, and vowed that I had been
served quite right, declared that I should not be removed from the school; and
sent old Swishtail a brace of pheasants for what he called his kindness to me.
Of these the old gentleman invited me to partake, and made a very queer speech
at dinner, as he was cutting them up, about the excellence of my parents, and
his own determination to be <em>kinder still</em> to me, if ever I ventured on such practices
again; so I was obliged to give up my old trade of lending, for the doctor
declared that any boy who borrowed should be flogged, and any one who <em>paid</em>
should be flogged twice as much. There was no standing against such a prohibition
as this, and my little commerce was ruined.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was not very high in the school: not having been able to get further than
that dreadful <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Propria quæ maribus</span></i> in the Latin grammar, of which, though I
have it by heart even now, I never could understand a syllable—but, on account
of my size, my age, and the prayers of my mother, was allowed to have the
privilege of the bigger boys, and on holidays to walk about in the town; great
dandies we were, too, when we thus went out. I recollect my costume very
well: a thunder-and-lightning coat, a white waistcoat, embroidered neatly at
the pockets, a lace frill, a pair of knee-breeches, and elegant white cotton or
silk stockings. This did very well, but still I was dissatisfied, I wanted <em>a pair
of boots</em>. Three boys in the school had boots—I was mad to have them too.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a German bootmaker who had just set up in <em>our</em> town in those
days, who afterwards made his fortune in London; I determined to have the
boots from him, and did not despair, before the end of a year or two, either to
leave the school, when I should not mind his dunning me, or to screw the money
from mamma, and so pay him.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I called upon this man, Stiffelkind was his name, and he took my measure
for a pair.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are a vary young gentleman to wear dop boots," said the shoemaker.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I suppose, fellow," says I, "that is my business and not yours; either make
the boots or not—but when you speak to a man of my rank, speak respectfully;"
and I poured out a number of oaths, in order to impress him with a notion of
my respectability.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had the desired effect.—"Stay, sir," says he, "I have a nice littel pair
of dop boots dat I tink will jost do for you," and he produced, sure enough, the
most elegant things I ever saw. "Day were made," said he, "for de Honourable
Mr. Stiffney, of de Gards, but were too small."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, indeed!" said I, "Stiffney is a relation of mine: and what, you scoundrel,
will you have the impudence to ask for these things?" He replied, "Three
pounds."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well," said I, "they are confoundedly dear, but as you will have a long
time to wait for your money, why I shall have my revenge, you see." The
man looked alarmed, and began a speech: "Sare, I cannot let dem go vidout;"—but
a bright thought struck me, and I interrupted—"Sir! don't sir me—take
off the boots, fellow, and, hark ye! when you speak to a nobleman, don't say—Sir."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A hundert tousand pardons, my lort," says he: "if I had known you were
a lort, I vood never have called you, Sir. Vat name shall I put down in my
books?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Name?—oh! why—<span class='sc'>Lord Cornwallis</span>, to be sure," said I, as I walked off
in the boots.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And vat shall I do vid my lort's shoes?" "Keep them until I send for
them," said I; and, giving him a patronizing bow, I walked out of the shop, as
the German tied up my shoes in a paper....</p>

<p class='c000'>This story I would not have told, but that my whole life turned upon these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>accursed boots. I walked back to school as proud as a peacock, and easily
succeeded in satisfying the boys as to the manner in which I came by my new
ornaments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, one fatal Monday morning, the blackest of all black-Mondays that ever
I knew—as we were all of us playing between school-hours—I saw a posse of
boys round a stranger, who seemed to be looking out for one of us—a sudden
trembling seized me—I knew it was Stiffelkind: what had brought him here?
He talked loud, and seemed angry—so I rushed into the school-room, and,
burying my head between my hands, began reading for the dear life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I vant Lort Cornvallis," said the horrid bootmaker. "His lortship belongs,
I know, to dis honourable school, for I saw him vid de boys at church,
yesterday."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Lord who?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vy, Lort Cornvallis, to be sure—a very fat yong nobleman, vid red hair, he
squints a little, and svears dreadfully."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There's no Lord Cornvallis here," said one—and there was a pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stop! I have it!" says that odious Bunting. "<em>It must be Stubbs</em>;" and
"Stubbs! Stubbs!" every one cried out, while I was so busy at my book as
not to hear a word.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last, two of the biggest chaps rushed into the school-room, and seizing
each an arm, run me into the play-ground—bolt up against the shoemaker.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dis is my man—I beg your lortship's pardon," says he, "I have brought
your lortship's shoes, vich you left—see, dey have been in dis parcel ever
since you vent avay in my boots."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Shoes, fellow!" says I, "I never saw your face before;" for I knew there
was nothing for it but brazening it out. "Upon the honour of a gentleman,"
said I, turning round to the boys—they hesitated; and if the trick had turned
in my favour, fifty of them would have seized hold of Stiffelkind, and drubbed
him soundly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stop!" says Bunting (hang him!), "let's see the shoes—if they fit him,
why, then, the cobbler's right." They did fit me, and not only that, but the
name of STUBBS was written in them at full length.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vat?" said Stiffelkind, "is he not a lort? so help me himmel, I never did
vonce tink of looking at de shoes, which have been lying, ever since, in dis
piece of brown paper;" and then gathering anger as he went on, thundered out
so much of his abuse of me, in his German-English, that the boys roared with
laughter. Swishtail came in in the midst of the disturbance, and asked what
the noise meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's only Lord Cornwallis, sir," said the boys, "battling with his shoemaker,
about the price of a pair of top-boots."</p>

<p class='c000'>"O, sir" said I, "it was only in fun that I called myself Lord Cornwallis."</p>

<p class='c000'>"In fun! Where are the boots? And you, sir, give me your bill." My
beautiful boots were brought; and Stiffelkind produced his bill. "Lord Cornwallis
to Samuel Stiffelkind, for a pair of boots—four guineas."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have been fool enough, sir," says the doctor, looking very stern, "to
let this boy impose upon you as a lord; and knave enough to charge him double
the value of the article you sold him. Take back the boots, sir, I wont pay a
penny of your bill; nor can you get a penny. As for you, sir, you miserable
swindler and cheat, I shall not flog you as I did before, but I shall send you
home: you are not fit to be the companion of honest boys."</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Suppose we duck him</em> before he goes," piped out a very small voice. The
doctor grinned significantly, and left the school-room; and the boys knew by
this they might have their will. They seized me, and carried me to the play-ground
pump—they pumped upon me until I was half dead, and the monster,
Stiffelkind, stood looking on for the half-hour the operation lasted.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose the doctor, at last, thought I had had pumping enough, for he rung
the school-bell, and the boys were obliged to leave me; as I got out of the
trough, Stiffelkind was alone with me. "Vell, my lort," says he, "you have
paid <em>something</em> for dese boots, but not all; by Jubider! <em>you shall never hear de
end of dem</em>." And I didn't.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>APRIL.—<span class='sc'>Fooling.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>After this, as you may fancy, I left this disgusting establishment, and lived for
some time along with pa and mamma at home. My education was finished, at
least mamma and I agreed that it was: and from boyhood until hobbadyhoyhood
(which I take to be about the sixteenth year of the life of a young man, and may
be likened to the month of April when spring begins to bloom), from fourteen until
seventeen, I say, I remained at home, doing nothing, for which I ever since have
had a great taste, the idol of my mamma, who took part in all my quarrels with
father, and used regularly to rob the weekly expenses in order to find me in pocket-money.
Poor soul! many and many is the guinea I have had from her in that way;
and so she enabled me to cut a very pretty figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Papa was for having me at this time articled to a merchant, or put to some profession;
but mamma and I agreed that I was born to be a gentleman, and not a
tradesman, and the army was the only place for me. Everybody was a soldier
in those times, for the French war had just begun, and the whole country was
swarming with militia regiments. "We'll get him a commission in a marching
regiment," said my father; "as we have no money to purchase him up, he'll <em>fight</em>
his way, I make no doubt;" and papa looked at me, with a kind of air of contempt,
as much as to say he doubted whether I should be very eager for such a dangerous
way of bettering myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>I wish you could have heard mamma's screech, when he talked so coolly of my
going out to fight. "What, send him abroad! across the horrid, horrid sea—to be
wrecked and, perhaps, drowned, and only to land for the purpose of fighting the
wicked Frenchmen,—to be wounded, and perhaps kick—kick—killed! Oh,
Thomas, Thomas! would you murder me and your boy?" There was a regular
scene;—however it ended, as it always did, in mother's getting the better, and it
was settled that I should go into the militia. And why not? the uniform is just as
handsome, and the danger not half so great. I don't think in the course of my
whole military experience I ever fought anything, except an old woman, who had
the impudence to hallo out, "Heads up, lobster!"—Well, I joined the North Bungays
and was fairly launched into the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was not a handsome man, I know; but there was <em>something</em> about me—that's
very evident—for the girls always laughed when they talked to me, and the men,
though they affected to call me a poor little creature, squint-eyes, knock-knees, red-head,
and so on, were evidently annoyed by my success, for they hated me so confoundedly.
Even at the present time they go on, though I have given up gallivanting,
as I call it. But in the April of my existence—that is, in Anno Domini
1791, or so—it was a different case; and having nothing else to do, and being
bent upon bettering my condition, I did some very pretty things in that way.
But I was not hot-headed and imprudent, like most young fellows.—Don't fancy I
looked for beauty! Pish!—I wasn't such a fool. Nor for temper; I don't care
about a bad temper: I could break any woman's heart in two years. What I
wanted was to get on in the world. Of course, I didn't <em>prefer</em> an ugly woman, or a
shrew; and, when the choice offered, would certainly put up with a handsome,
good-humoured girl, with plenty of money, as any honest man would.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now there were two tolerably rich girls in our parts: Miss Magdalen Crutty, with
twelve thousand pounds (and, to do her justice, as plain a girl as ever I saw), and
Miss Mary Waters, a fine, tall, plump, smiling, peach-cheeked, golden-haired, white-skinned
lass, with only ten. Mary Waters lived with her uncle, the Doctor, who
had helped me into the world, and who was trusted with this little orphan charge
very soon after. My mother, as you have heard, was so fond of Bates, and Bates
so fond of little Mary, that both, at first, were almost always in our house: and I
used to call her my little wife, as soon as I could speak, and before she could
walk, almost. It was beautiful to see us, the neighbours said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, when her brother, the lieutenant of an India ship, came to be captain, and
actually gave Mary five thousand pounds, when she was about ten years old, and
promised her five thousand more, there was a great talking, and bobbing, and
smiling, between the Doctor and my parents, and Mary and I were left together
more than ever, and she was told to call me her little husband: and she did, and it
was considered a settled thing from that day. She was really amazingly fond of me.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Can any one call me mercenary after that? Though Miss Crutty had twelve
thousand, and Mary only ten (five in hand, and five in the bush), I stuck faithfully
to Mary. As a matter of course, Miss Crutty hated Miss Waters. The fact
was, Mary had all the country dangling after her, and not a soul would come to
Magdalen, for all her £12,000. I used to be attentive to her, though (as it's
always useful to be); and Mary would sometimes laugh and sometimes cry at my
flirting with Magdalen. This I thought proper very quickly to check. "Mary,"
said I, "you know that my love for you is disinterested,—for I am faithful to you,
though Miss Crutty is richer than you. Don't fly into a rage, then, because I pay
her attentions, when you know that my heart and my promise are engaged to you."</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact is, to tell a little bit of a secret, there is nothing like the having two
strings to your bow. "Who knows?" thought I, "Mary may die; and then where
are my £10,000?" So I used to be very kind indeed to Miss Crutty; and well it
was that I was so: for when I was twenty, and Mary eighteen, I'm blest if news
did not arrive that Captain Waters, who was coming home to England with all his
money in rupees, had been taken—ship, rupees, self and all—by a French privateer;
and Mary, instead of £10,000, had only £5000, making a difference of no
less than £350 per annum betwixt her and Miss Crutty.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had just joined my regiment (the famous North Bungay Fencibles, Colonel
Craw commanding) when this news reached me; and you may fancy how a young
man, in an expensive regiment and mess, having uniforms and whatnot to pay
for, and a figure to cut in the world, felt at hearing such news! "My dearest
Robert," wrote Miss Waters, "will deplore my dear brother's loss: but not, I am
sure, the money which that kind and generous soul had promised me. I have still
five thousand pounds, and with this and your own little fortune (I had £1000 in the
five per cents.!) we shall be as happy and contented as possible."</p>

<p class='c000'>Happy and contented, indeed! Didn't I know how my father got on with his
£300 a-year, and how it was all he could do out of it to add a hundred a-year to
my narrow income, and live himself! My mind was made up—I instantly mounted
the coach, and flew to our village,—to Mr. Crutty's, of course. It was next door
to Doctor Bates's; but I had no business <em>there</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found Magdalen in the garden. "Heavens, Mr. Stubbs!" said she, as in my
new uniform I appeared before her, "I really did never—such a handsome officer—expect
to see you;" and she made as if she would blush, and began to tremble
violently. I led her to a garden seat. I seized her hand—it was not withdrawn.
I pressed it;—I thought the pressure was returned. I flung myself on my knees,
and then I poured into her ear a little speech which I had made on the top of the
coach. "Divine Miss Crutty," said I; "idol of my soul! It was but to catch one
glimpse of you that I passed through this garden. I never intended to breathe the
secret passion (oh, no! of course not) which was wearing my life away. You
know my unfortunate pre-engagement,—it is broken, and <em>for ever</em>! I am free!—free,
but to be your slave,—your humblest, fondest, truest slave:" and so on.....</p>

<p class='c000'>"O, Mr. Stubbs," said she, as I imprinted a kiss upon her cheek, "I can't refuse
you; but I fear you are a sad, naughty man...."</p>

<p class='c000'>Absorbed in the delicious reverie which was caused by the dear creature's confusion,
we were both silent for a while, and should have remained so for hours,
perhaps, so lost were we in happiness, had I not been suddenly roused by a voice
exclaiming from behind us,</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Don't cry, Mary; he is a swindling, sneaking scoundrel, and you are well rid
of him!</em>"</p>

<p class='c000'>I turned round! O, Heaven! there stood Mary, weeping on Doctor Bates's arm,
while that miserable apothecary was looking at me with the utmost scorn. The
gardener who had let me in had told them of my arrival, and now stood grinning
behind them. "Imperence!" was my Magdalen's only exclamation, as she flounced
by with the utmost self-possession, while I, glancing daggers at <em>the spies</em>, followed
her. We retired to the parlour, where she repeated to me the strongest assurances
of her love.</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought I was a made man. Alas! I was only an APRIL FOOL!</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>MAY.—<span class='sc'>Restoration Day.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>As the month of May is considered, by poets and other philosophers, to be
devoted by Nature to the great purpose of love-making, I may as well take
advantage of that season and acquaint you with the result of <em>my</em> amours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young, gay, fascinating, and an ensign, I had completely won the heart of
my Magdalen; and as for Miss Waters and her nasty uncle the Doctor, there
was a complete split between us, as you may fancy; Miss, pretending, forsooth,
that she was glad I had broken off the match, though she would have
given her eyes, the little minx, to have had it on again. But this was out of
the question. My father, who had all sorts of queer notions, said I had acted
like a rascal in the business; my mother took my part, in course, and declared
I acted rightly, as I always did: and I got leave of absence from the regiment
in order to press my beloved Magdalen to marry me out of hand—knowing,
from reading and experience, the extraordinary mutability of human affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides, as the dear girl was seventeen years older than myself, and as bad
in health as she was in temper, how was I to know that the grim king of
terrors might not carry her off before she became mine? With the tenderest
warmth, then, and most delicate ardour, I continued to press my suit. The
happy day was fixed—the ever-memorable 10th of May, 1792; the wedding
clothes were ordered; and, to make things secure, I penned a little paragraph
for the county paper to this effect:—"Marriage in High Life. We understand
that Ensign Stubbs, of the North Bungay Fencibles, and son of Thomas Stubbs,
of Sloffemsquiggle, Esquire, is about to lead to the hymeneal altar the lovely
and accomplished daughter of Solomon Crutty, Esquire, of the same place. A
fortune of twenty thousand pounds is, we hear, the lady's portion. 'None but
the brave deserve the fair....'"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you informed your relatives, my beloved," said I to Magdalen one
day after sending the above notice; "will any of them attend at your marriage?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Uncle Sam will, I daresay," said Miss Crutty, "dear mamma's brother."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And who <em>was</em> your dear mamma?" said I, for Miss Crutty's respected
parent had been long since dead, and I never heard her name mentioned in
the family.</p>

<p class='c000'>Magdalen blushed, and cast down her eyes to the ground. "Mamma was a
foreigner," at last she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And of what country?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A German; papa married her when she was very young:—she was not of
a very good family," said Miss Crutty, hesitating.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what care I for family, my love," said I, tenderly kissing the knuckles
of the hand which I held; "she must have been an angel who gave birth to
you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She was a shoemaker's daughter."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A German shoemaker!</em> hang 'em, thought I, I have had enough of them, and
so I broke up this conversation, which did not somehow please me....</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, the day was drawing near: the clothes were ordered; the banns were
read. My dear mamma had built a cake about the size of a washing-tub: and
I was only waiting for a week to pass to put me in possession of twelve
thousand pounds in the <em>five</em> per cents., as they were in those days, Heaven bless
em! Little did I know the storm that was brewing, and the disappointment
which was to fall upon a young man who really did his best to get a fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>"O Robert!" said my Magdalen to me, two days before the match was to
come off, "I have <em>such</em> a kind letter from uncle Sam, in London. I wrote to
him as you wished. He says that he is coming down to-morrow; that he has
heard of you often, and knows your character very well, and that he has got a
<em>very handsome present</em> for us! What can it be, I wonder?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is he rich, my soul's adored?" says I.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is a bachelor with a fine trade, and nobody to leave his money to."</p>

<p class='c000'>"His present can't be less than a thousand pounds," says I.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Or, perhaps, a silver tea-set, and some corner dishes," says she.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we could not agree to this: it was too little—too mean for a man of her
uncle's wealth; and we both determined it must be the thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>"Dear, good uncle! he's to be here by the coach," says Magdalen. "Let us
ask a little party to meet him." And so we did, and so they came. My father
and mother, old Crutty in his best wig, and the parson who was to marry us next
day. The coach was to come in at six. And there was the tea-table, and there
was the punch-bowl, and everybody ready and smiling to receive our dear uncle
from London.</p>

<p class='c000'>Six o'clock came, and the coach, and the man from the Green Dragon with a
portmanteau, and a fat old gentleman walking behind, of whom I just caught a
glimpse—a venerable old gentleman—I thought I'd seen him before....</p>

<p class='c000'>Then there was a ring at the bell; then a scuffling and bumping at the passage:
then old Crutty rushed out, and a great laughing and talking, and "<em>How
are you?</em>" and so on, was heard at the door; and then the parlour-door was
flung open, and Crutty cried out with a loud voice—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Good people all! my brother-in-law, Mr. STIFFELKIND!"</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Stiffelkind!</em>—I trembled as I heard the name!</p>

<p class='c000'>Miss Crutty kissed him; mamma made him a curtsey, and papa made him a
bow; and Dr. Snorter, the parson, seized his hand and shook it most warmly—then
came my turn!</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vat," says he, "it is my dear goot yong friend from Doctor Schvis'hentail's!
is dis the yong gentleman's honourable moder" (mamma smiled and made
a curtsey), "and dis his fader! Sare and madam, you should be broud of soch a
sonn. And you, my niece, if you have him for a husband you vil be locky, dat
is all. Vat dink you, broder Crotty, and Madame Stobbs, I ave made your sonn's
boots, ha! ha!"</p>

<p class='c000'>My mamma laughed, and said, "I did not know it, but I am sure, sir, he has
as pretty a leg for a boot as any in the whole county."</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Stiffelkind roared louder. "A very nice leg, ma'am, and a very <em>sheap
boot too</em>! Vat, you did not know I make his boots! Perhaps you did not know
someting else too—p'rhaps you did not know" (and here the monster clapped his
hand on the table, and made the punch-ladle tremble in the bowl), "p'rhaps you
did not know as dat yong man, dat Stobbs, dat sneaking, baltry, squinting fellow,
is as vicked as he is ogly. He bot a pair of boots from me and never paid
for dem. Dat is noting, nobody never pays; but he bought a pair of boots, and
called himself Lord Cornvallis. And I was fool enough to believe him vonce.
But look you, niece Magdalen, I ave got five tousand pounds, if you marry him
I vil not give you a benny; but look you, what I will gif you, I bromised you
a bresent, and I vil give you <span class='fss'>DESE</span>!"</p>

<p class='c000'>And the old monster produced <span class='fss'>THOSE VERY BOOTS</span> which Swishtail had made
him take back....</p>

<p class='c000'>I <em>didn't</em> marry Miss Crutty: I am not sorry for it though. She was a nasty,
ugly, ill-tempered wretch, and I've always said so ever since.</p>

<p class='c000'>And all this arose from those infernal boots, and that unlucky paragraph in
the county paper—I'll tell you how.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, it was taken up as a quiz by one of the wicked, profligate,
unprincipled organs of the London press, who chose to be very facetious about
the "Marriage in High Life," and made all sorts of jokes about me and my dear
Miss Crutty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, it was read in this London paper by my mortal enemy, Bunting,
who had been introduced to old Stiffelkind's acquaintance by my adventure with
him, and had his shoes made regularly by that foreign upstart.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, he happened to want a pair of shoes mended at this particular period,
and as he was measured by the disgusting old High-Dutch Cobbler, he told him
his old friend Stubbs was going to be married.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And to whom?" said old Stiffelkind, "to a voman wit gelt, I vil take my oath."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," says Bunting, "a country girl—a Miss Magdalen Carotty or Crotty,
a place called Sloffemsquiggle."</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Schloffemschwiegel!</em>" bursts out the dreadful bootmaker, "Mein Gott, mein Gott!
das geht nicht—I tell you, sare, it is no go. Miss Crotty is my niece. I vill go
down myself. I vill never let her marry dat goot-for-noting schwindler and
teif." <em>Such</em> was the language that the scoundrel ventured to use regarding me!</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Was there ever such confounded ill-luck? My whole life has been a tissue of ill
luck: although I have laboured, perhaps, harder than any man to make a fortune,
something always tumbled it down. In love and in war I was not like others. In
my marriages, I had an eye to the main chance; and you see how some unlucky
blow would come and throw them over. In the army I was just as prudent, and
just as unfortunate. What with judicious betting, and horse-swapping, good luck
at billiards, and economy, I do believe I put by my pay every year,—and that is
what few can say who have but an allowance of a hundred a-year.</p>

<p class='c000'>I'll tell you how it was. I used to be very kind to the young men; I chose their
horses for them, and their wine; and showed them how to play billiards, or écarté,
of long mornings, when there was nothing better to do. I didn't cheat: I'd rather
die than cheat; but if fellows <em>will</em> play, I wasn't the man to say no—why should
I? There was one young chap in our regiment of whom I really think I cleared
300<em>l.</em> a-year.</p>

<p class='c000'>His name was Dobble. He was a tailor's son, and wanted to be a gentleman.
A poor, weak young creature; easy to be made tipsy: easy to be cheated; and
easy to be frightened. It was a blessing for him that I found him; for if anybody
else had, they would have plucked him of every shilling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ensign Dobble and I were sworn friends. I rode his horses for him, and chose
his champagne: and did everything, in fact, that a superior mind does for an
inferior—when the inferior has got the money. We were inseparables—hunting
everywhere in couples. We even managed to fall in love with two sisters, as young
soldiers will do, you know; for the dogs fall in love with every change of quarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well: once, in the year 1793 (it was just when the French had chopped poor
Louis's head off), Dobble and I, gay young chaps as ever wore sword by side, had
cast our eyes upon two young ladies, by the name of Brisket, daughters of a butcher
in the town where we were quartered. The dear girls fell in love with us, of
course. And many a pleasant walk in the country; many a treat to a tea-garden;
many a smart riband and brooch, used Dobble and I (for his father allowed him
600<em>l.</em>, and our purses were in common) to present to these young ladies. One day,
fancy our pleasure at receiving a note couched thus:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Deer Capting Stubbs and Dobble—Miss Briskets presents their compliments,
and as it is probble that our papa will be till 12 at the corprayshun dinner, we
request the pleasure of their company to tea."</p>

<p class='c000'>Didn't we go! Punctually at six we were in the little back parlour; we quaffed
more Bohea, and made more love, than half-a-dozen ordinary men could. At nine,
a little punch-bowl succeeded to the little tea-pot; and, bless the girls! a nice
fresh steak was frizzling on the gridiron for our supper. Butchers were butchers
then, and their parlour was their kitchen, too; at least old Brisket's was.—One
door leading into the shop, and one into the yard, on the other side of which was
the slaughter-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fancy, then, our horror when, just at this critical time, we heard the shop door
open, a heavy staggering step on the flags, and a loud husky voice from the shop,
shouting, "Hallo, Susan! hallo, Betsy! show a light!" Dobble turned as white
as a sheet; the two girls each as red as a lobster; I alone preserved my presence
of mind. "The back door," says I.—"The dog's in the court," says they. "He's
not so bad as the man," says I. "Stop," cries Susan, flinging open the door, and
rushing to the fire: "take <em>this</em>, and perhaps it will quiet him."</p>

<p class='c000'>What do you think "<em>this</em>" was? I'm blest if it was not the <em>steak</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'>She pushed us out, patted and hushed the dog, and was in again in a minute.
The moon was shining on the court, and on the slaughter-house, where there hung
a couple of white, ghastly-looking carcasses of a couple of sheep; a great gutter
ran down the court—a gutter of <em>blood</em>!—the dog was devouring his beefsteak (<em>our</em>
beefsteak) in silence,—and we could see through the little window the girls bustling
about to pack up the supper-things, and presently the shop door opened, old Brisket
entered, staggering, angry, and drunk. What's more, we could see, perched on a
high stool, and nodding politely, as if to salute old Brisket, the <em>feather of Dobble's
cocked hat</em>! When Dobble saw it he turned white, and deadly sick; and the poor
fellow, in an agony of fright, sunk shivering down upon one of the butcher's cutting
blocks which was in the yard.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/i_301_full.jpg'><img src='images/i_301.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>We saw old Brisket look steadily (as steadily as he could) at the confounded
impudent, pert waggling feather; and then an idea began to dawn upon his mind,
that there was a head to the hat; and then he slowly rose up—he was a man of
six feet, and fifteen stone—he rose up, put on his apron and sleeves, and <em>took down
his cleaver</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Betsy," says he, "open the yard door." But the poor girls screamed, and flung
on their knees, and begged, and wept, and did their very best to prevent him.
"OPEN THE YARD DOOR," says he, with a thundering loud voice; and the
great bull-dog, hearing it, started up, and uttered a yell which sent me flying to
the other end of the court.—Dobble couldn't move; he was sitting on the block,
blubbering like a baby.</p>

<p class='c000'>The door opened, and out Mr. Brisket came.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>To him, Jowler</em>," says he, "<em>keep him, Jowler</em>,"—and the horrid dog flew at me,
and I flew back into the corner, and drew my sword, determining to sell my life
dearly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's it," says Brisket, "keep him there,—good dog,—good dog! And now,
sir," says he, turning to Dobble, "is this your hat?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," says Dobble, fit to choke with fright.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, then," says Brisket, "it's my—(hick)—my painful duty to—(hick)—to
tell you, that as I've got your hat, I must have your head;—it's painful, but it
must be done. You'd better—(hick)—settle yourself com—comfumarably against
that—(hick)—that block, and I'll chop it off before you can say Jack—(hick)—no,
I mean Jack Robinson."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dobble went down on his knees, and shrieked out, "I'm an only son, Mr.
Brisket! I'll marry her, sir; I will, upon my honour, sir.—Consider my mother,
sir; consider my mother."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's it, sir," says Brisket—"that's a good boy—(hick)—a good boy; just put
your head down quietly—and I'll have it off—yes, off—as if you were Louis the
Six—the Sixtix—the Sixtickleteenth.—I'll chop the other <em>chap afterwards</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>When I heard this, I made a sudden bound back, and gave such a cry as any
man might who was in such a way. The ferocious Jowler, thinking I was going
to escape, flew at my throat; screaming furious, I flung out my arms in a kind of
desperation,—and, to my wonder, down fell the dog, dead, and run through the
body!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>At this moment a posse of people rushed in upon old Brisket—one of his
daughters had had the sense to summon them—and Dobble's head was saved.
And when they saw the dog lying dead at my feet, my ghastly look, my bloody
sword, they gave me no small credit for my bravery. "A terrible fellow, that
Stubbs," said they; and so the mess said, the next day.</p>

<p class='c000'>I didn't tell them that the dog had committed <em>suicide</em>—why should I? And I
didn't say a word about Dobble's cowardice. I said he was a brave fellow, and
fought like a tiger; and this prevented <em>him</em> from telling tales. I had the dog-skin
made into a pair of pistol-holsters, and looked so fierce, and got such a name for
courage in our regiment, that when we had to meet the regulars, Bob Stubbs was
always the man put forward to support the honour of the corps. The women, you
know, adore courage; and such was my reputation at this time, that I might have
had my pick out of half-a-dozen, with three, four, or five thousand pounds a-piece,
who were dying for love of me and my red coat. But I wasn't such a fool. I had
been twice on the point of marriage, and twice disappointed; and I vowed by all
the Saints to have a wife, and a rich one. Depend upon this, as an infallible
maxim to guide you through life—<em>It's as easy to get a rich wife as a poor one</em>;—the
same bait that will hook a fly will hook a salmon.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SO-HO-LOGICAL SOCIETY.</h3>

<p class='c016'>At the annual July meeting of this renowned establishment, petitions were
presented from the animals of the menagerie, respecting their grievances: the
following were the greatest cases of hardship:—The Carnivora, in a body,
complained of a diminution and recent alteration in their diet; the Society
having, from a regard to economy and its diminished finances, changed their
food from good ox beef to asses' flesh. They feared that, should they become
addicted to this kind of viand, they might, in a moment of desperation, be
tempted, from the similarity, to make free with the bodies of any of the members
that came in their way, a piece of ingratitude of which the great brown
bruin, in particular, said he could not bear the thought. The Royal Tigers
complained that some of their family had been carried off by a disorder resembling
the "King's evil;" this they attributed to the Society's being
under Royal patronage, which they had, in the course of their travels, observed
to be fatal in many other establishments. The Dogs begged that, if
they were to have no more meat, they might, at least, be indulged with a
copy of "South on the Bones." The beasts and birds, generally, declared
themselves ashamed of the shabby appearance of their friends in the Museum,
asserting that, living and dead, they were alike badly stuffed. The Parrots
spoke of the smallness of their cages, which, they entreated, might be enlarged
in dimensions by at least a perch or two. The whole tribe of Simiæ,
like the Baronets, prayed for a badge of distinction. They stated that their
appearance was so closely imitated by numerous individuals who crowded
around their cages on fine days in the fashionable season, that their visitors
did not know one from the other, and frequently asked "Which <em>are</em> the
monkeys?"</p>

<p class='c000'>All the animals prayed the benefit of clergy for the remission of their Sunday
fasts, and implored the Bishop of London, though he could not get them
a holiday on that day, to at least interfere to procure them a dinner.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Dobble's reputation for courage was not increased by the butcher's-dog adventure;
but mine stood very high: little Stubbs was voted the boldest chap of all
the bold North-Bungays. And though I must confess, what was proved by
subsequent circumstances, that Nature has <em>not</em> endowed me with a large, or
even, I may say, an average share of bravery, yet a man is very willing to
flatter himself of the contrary; and, after a little time, I got to believe that my
killing the dog was an action of undaunted courage; and that I was as gallant
as any one of the hundred thousand heroes of our army. I always had a military
taste—it's only the brutal part of the profession, the horrid fighting, and blood,
that I don't like.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose the regiment was not very brave itself—being only militia; but,
certain it was that Stubbs was considered a most terrible fellow, and I swore
so much, and looked so fierce, that you would have fancied I had made half a
hundred campaigns. I was second in several duels; the umpire in all disputes;
and such a crack-shot myself that fellows were shy of insulting me. As for
Dobble, I took him under my protection; and he became so attached to me that
we ate, drank, and rode together, every day; his father didn't care for money,
so long as his son was in good company—and what so good as that of the celebrated
Stubbs? Heigho! I <em>was</em> good company in those days, and a brave fellow,
too, as I should have remained, but for—what I shall tell the public immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened, in the fatal year ninety-six, that the brave North-Bungays were
quartered at Portsmouth; a maritime place, which I need not describe, and
which I wish I had never seen. I might have been a General now, or, at least,
a rich man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The red-coats carried everything before them in those days; and I, such a
crack character as I was in my regiment, was very well received by the towns-people;
many dinners I had; many tea-parties; many lovely young ladies did
I lead down the pleasant country-dances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well; although I had had the two former rebuffs in love, which I have described,
my heart was still young; and the fact was, knowing that a girl with a
fortune was my only chance, I made love here as furiously as ever. I shan't
describe the lovely creatures on whom I had fixed whilst at Portsmouth. I
tried more than—several—and it is a singular fact, which I never have been
able to account for, that, successful as I was with ladies of maturer age, by the
young ones I was refused regular.</p>

<p class='c000'>But "faint heart never won fair lady;" and so I went on, and on, until I had
really got a Miss Clopper, a tolerably rich navy-contractor's daughter, into such
a way that I really don't think she could have refused me. Her brother, Captain
Clopper, was in a line regiment, and helped me as much as ever he could; he
swore I was such a brave fellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I had received a number of attentions from Clopper, I determined to invite
him to dinner; which I could do without any sacrifice of my principle, upon this
point; for the fact is, Dobble lived at an inn—and as he sent all his bills to his
father, I made no scruple to use his table. We dined in the coffee-room; Dobble
bringing his friend, and so we made a party <em>carry</em>, as the French say. Some
naval officers were occupied in a similar way at a table next to ours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well—I didn't spare the bottle, either for myself or my friends; and we grew
very talkative, and very affectionate as the drinking went on. Each man told
stories of his gallantry in the field, or amongst the ladies, as officers will, after
dinner. Clopper confided to the company his wish that I should marry his
sister, and vowed that he thought me the best fellow in Christendom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ensign Dobble assented to this—"But let Miss Clopper beware," says he,
"for Stubbs is a sad fellow; he has had I don't know how many <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaisons</span></i>
already; and he has been engaged to I don't know how many women."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Indeed!" says Clopper. "Come, Stubbs, tell us your adventures."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Psha!" said I, modestly, "there is nothing, indeed, to tell; I have been in
love, my dear boy—who has not?—and I have been jilted—who has not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Clopper swore that he would blow his sister's brains out if ever <em>she</em> served me so.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>"Tell him about Miss Crutty," said Dobble; "he! he! Stubbs served <em>that</em>
woman out, any how; she didn't jilt <em>him</em>, I'll be sworn."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Really, Dobble, you are too bad, and should not mention names; the fact
is, the girl was desperately in love with me, and had money—sixty thousand
pounds, upon my reputation. Well, everything was arranged, when, who
should come down from London, but a relation."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well; and did he prevent the match?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Prevent it—yes, sir, I believe you, he did; though not in the sense that <em>you</em>
mean; he would have given his eyes: ay, and ten thousand pounds more, if I
would have accepted the girl, but I would not."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, in the name of goodness?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sir, her uncle was a <em>shoemaker</em>. I never would debase myself by marrying
into such a family."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course not," said Dobble, "he couldn't, you know. Well, now—tell him
about the other girl, Mary Waters, you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hush, Dobble, hush! don't you see one of those naval officers has turned
round and heard you? My dear Clopper, it was a mere childish bagatelle."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, but let's have it," said Clopper, "let's have it; I won't tell my sister,
you know;" and he put his hand to his nose, and looked monstrous wise.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nothing of that sort, Clopper—no, no—'pon honour—little Bob Stubbs is no
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">libertine</span></i>; and the story is very simple. You see that my father has a small place,
merely a few hundred acres, at Sloffemsquiggle. Isn't it a funny name? Hang it,
there's the naval gentleman staring again,—(I looked terribly fierce as I returned
this officer's stare, and continued in a loud, careless voice) well—at this Sloffemsquiggle
there lived a girl, a Miss Waters, the niece of some blackguard apothecary
in the neighbourhood; but my mother took a fancy to the girl, and had her
up to the park, and petted her. We were both young—and—and—the girl fell
in love with me, that's the fact. I was obliged to repel some rather warm
advances that she made me; and here, upon my honour as a gentleman, you
have all the story about which that silly Dobble makes such a noise."</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as I finished this sentence, I found myself suddenly taken by the nose,
and a voice shouting out,—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mr. Stubbs, you are <span class='sc'>a Liar and a Scoundrel</span>! take this, sir,—and this, for
daring to meddle with the name of an innocent lady."</p>

<p class='c000'>I turned round as well as I could, for the ruffian had pulled me out of my chair,
and beheld a great marine monster, six feet high, who was occupied in beating
and kicking me, in the most ungentlemanly manner, on my cheeks, my ribs, and
between the tails of my coat. "He is a liar, gentlemen, and a scoundrel; the
bootmaker had detected him in swindling, and so his niece refused him. Miss
Waters was engaged to him from childhood, and he deserted her for the bootmaker's
niece, who was richer;"—and then sticking a card between my stock
and my coat-collar, in what is called the scruff of my neck, the disgusting brute
gave me another blow behind my back, and left the coffee-room with his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dobble raised me up; and taking the card from my neck, read, CAPTAIN
WATERS. Clopper poured me out a glass of water, and said in my ear, "If
this is true, you are an infernal scoundrel, Stubbs; and must fight me, after
Captain Waters," and he flounced out of the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had but one course to pursue. I sent the Captain a short and contemptuous
note, saying, that he was beneath my anger. As for Clopper, I did not condescend
to notice his remark; but in order to get rid of the troublesome society
of these low blackguards, I determined to gratify an inclination I had long entertained,
and make a little tour. I applied for leave of absence, and set off <em>that
very night</em>. I can fancy the disappointment of the brutal Waters, on coming, as
he did, the next morning, to my quarters and finding me <em>gone</em>, ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c000'>After this adventure I became sick of a military life—at least, the life of my
own regiment, where the officers, such was their unaccountable meanness and
prejudice against me, absolutely refused to see me at mess. Colonel Craw sent
me a letter to this effect, which I treated as it deserved.—I never once alluded
to it in any way, and have since never spoken a single word to any man in the
North-Bungays.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lions of the day from all parts of the world are pledged to
be present, among others those of Mr. Van Amburgh. The man
with the goats and monkeys as yet sticks out for terms. Miss
Amany Amal and sisters will remain in this country, and attend,
by permission from the Adelphi, to communicate their interesting
discoveries in Indian Toe-pography. The president of the Nose-all-ogical
Society will be engaged, as also Grace Darling, if not too
dear.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Deputation from the Female Temperance Society will wait on
the section devoted to the investigation of mesmerism, to know if
they may take infinitesimal doses of brandy in their tea; and the
section of moral science will be requested, for the satisfaction of the
scrupulous, to state whether persons who abjure gin, rum, and
brandy, because they do not like them, are, therefore, fit members of
a temperance society.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Murphy will announce his discovery of the real philosopher's
stone, by which he will prove to them the possibility of converting
all sorts of rubbish into gold. It is intended to present to
him the freedom of the town in a brass snuff-box.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Crow will read a paper on the sagacity of rooks, in which he
will propound and defend the extraordinary conjecture that they
never make a noise without caws.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Deputation from the Fellows of the Zoological Society will
attend, to request the Homœopathic section to devise some means
for the application of animal magnetism to the purpose of drawing
more visitors to the menagerie. Many of the public, it seems, are
cured of their wish for seeing "by smelling only;" and as it is supposed
that the council "nose" all about it, they will now begin to
<em>vent-too-late</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Owen will attempt to explain his plans for getting rid of old
discord by the establishment of New Harmony, and his peculiar
notions of the preservation of peace, by the disposal of the ladies on
the circulating library principle. Should he prove unable to make
his views clear, either to his auditors or himself, he will finish with
a catalogue of his own perfections, accompanied on the trumpet
stop of the town organ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Graham and her husband will cause to be read to the meeting
a paper, detailing numerous experiments, all tending to prove
that it is a popular fallacy to suppose that balloons have a tendency
to rise in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Curtis will exhibit his celebrated acoustic chair, and explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>its capabilities. He will display the gold medal presented to him by
Government for the loan of it during the last year, and will show
how a foreign or colonial secretary may slumber in it from morn till
night, and yet hear what is going on all over the world. Mr. Curtis
will further develope, by experiments on all who choose to try, its
amazing property, by which a gentleman has only to sit in the
chair, and appear to sleep, when he will be astonished to hear what
all the world says of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Serjeant Talfourd will read a paper on the wrongs of authors,
and instance many affecting cases in which, after having been allowed
to live in splendour for a few years, they have been so reduced,
by the illiberality of the trade and the ingratitude of the public, as
to actually want a bottle of Champagne. He will illustrate the state
of civil degradation to which they are reduced by the fact that at
one of his literary dinners, a gentleman who had laboured in the
Grub Street line all his life, actually did not know the names of
some of the dishes set before him. Mr. Babbage will follow, with
calculations produced by his machine, proving that every book is
profitable, and that booksellers have neither rent, taxes, stock, nor
bad debts to trouble them. He will allude to the fact of a West-end
publisher having lately retired with a competence, and will suggest
the propriety of a special meeting to inquire into the circumstances
of such an atrocity. He will be supported by Captain Ross, who,
however, will <em>not</em> state that author-ship is the worst vessel in which
he ever put to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Fang, of Manchester, will present an interesting series
of tests for ascertaining the existence of the vital principle in Factory
children after they drop; and will suggest various novel stimulants
when the billy roller has ceased to be effective. He will point
out the evil of legislating on the subject of their ages, of which he
will show the impossibility of obtaining the requisite proofs, arising
from that beautiful economy of nature which bestows nothing in
vain, and, therefore, withholds from them the usual supply of teeth,
seeing that they have no time to use them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Doubledose will communicate some interesting discoveries in
the science of taw-tology, illustrated with real marbles. All the
town's boys will be allowed to stand at this sitting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many other elaborate papers will be read to the various sections;
but, as they will generally be about nothing, it is considered that
they need trouble nobody.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Williams, of the Old Bailey, will attend, for the accommodation
of the visitors, with a copious supply of pewter plates, two-pronged
forks, and handsome waiting maids; and a constant succession
of buttocks and flanks, hot and hot, will be received by every
train from Euston Square.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inhabitants of the town are determined to shew their hospitality
to the illustrious strangers they expect, and all the bachelors
of arts and unmarried professors will be warmly welcomed at the
houses of the single ladies.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>AUGUST.—<span class='sc'>Dogs have their Days.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>See, now, what life is; I have had ill-luck on ill-luck from that day to this.
I have sunk in the world, and, instead of riding my horse and drinking my wine,
as a real gentleman should, have hardly enough now to buy a pint of ale; ay,
and am very glad when anybody will treat me to one. Why, why was I born
to undergo such unmerited misfortunes?</p>

<p class='c000'>You must know that very soon after my adventure with Miss Crutty, and that
cowardly ruffian, Captain Waters (he sailed the day after his insult to me, or I
should most certainly have blown his brains out; <em>now</em> he is living in England,
and is my relation; but, of course, I cut the fellow). Very soon after these
painful events another happened, which ended, too, in a sad disappointment.
My dear papa died, and instead of leaving five thousand pounds as I expected,
at the very least, left only his estate, which was worth but two. The land and
house were left to me; to mamma and my sisters he left, to be sure, a sum of two
thousand pounds in the hands of that eminent firm, Messrs. Pump, Aldgate, and
Co., which failed within six months after his demise; and paid in five years about
one shilling and ninepence in the pound; which really was all my dear mother
and sisters had to live upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor creatures were quite unused to money matters; and, would you
believe it? when the news came of Pump and Aldgate's failure, mamma only
smiled, and threw her eyes up to Heaven, and said, "Blessed be God, that we
have still wherewithal to live: there are tens of thousands in this world, dear
children, who would count our poverty riches." And with this she kissed my
two sisters, who began to blubber, as girls always will do, and threw their arms
round her neck, and then round my neck, until I was half stifled with their embraces,
and slobbered all over with their tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dearest mamma," said I, "I am very glad to see the noble manner in which
you bear your loss; and more still to know that you are so rich as to be able to
put up with it." The fact was, I really thought the old lady had got a private
hoard of her own, as many of them have—a thousand pounds or so in a stocking.
Had she put by thirty pounds a year, as well she might, for the thirty years of
her marriage, there would have been nine hundred pounds clear, and no mistake.
But still I was angry to think that any such paltry concealment had been practised—concealment
too of <em>my</em> money; so I turned on her pretty sharply, and
continued my speech. "You say, ma'am, that you are rich, and that Pump and
Aldgate's failure has no effect upon you. I am very happy to hear you say so,
ma'am—very happy that you <em>are</em> rich; and I should like to know where your
property, my father's property, for you had none of your own,—I should like to
know where this money lies—<em>where you have concealed it</em>, ma'am, and permit me
to say, that when I agreed to board you and my two sisters for eighty pounds a
year, I did not know that you had <em>other</em> resources than those mentioned in my
blessed father's will."</p>

<p class='c000'>This I said to her because I hated the meanness of concealment, not because
I lost by the bargain of boarding them, for the three poor things did not eat
much more than sparrows; and I've often since calculated that I had a clear
twenty pounds a year profit out of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mamma and the girls looked quite astonished when I made the speech.
"What does he mean?" said Lucy to Eliza.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mamma repeated the question, "My beloved Robert, what concealment are
you talking of?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am talking of concealed property, ma'am," says I, sternly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And do you—what—can you—do you really suppose that I have concealed—any
of that blessed sa-a-a-aint's prop-op-op-operty?" screams out mamma.
"Robert," says she, "Bob, my own darling boy—my fondest, best beloved, now
<em>he</em> is gone" (meaning my late governor—more tears), "you don't, you cannot
fancy that your own mother, who bore you, and nursed you, and wept for you,
and would give her all to save you from a moment's harm—you don't suppose
that she would che-e-e-eat you?" and here she gave a louder screech than ever,
and flung back on the sofa, and one of my sisters went and tumbled into her
arms, and t'other went round, and the kissing and slobbering scene went on
again, only I was left out, thank goodness; I hate such sentimentality.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>"<em>Che-e-e-at me</em>," says I, mocking her. "What do you mean, then, by saying
you're so rich? Say, have you got money or have you not?" (and I rapped
out a good number of oaths, too, which I don't put in here; but I was in a
dreadful fury, that's the fact).</p>

<p class='c000'>"So help me, Heaven," says mamma, in answer, going down on her knees,
and smacking her two hands; "I have but a Queen Anne's guinea in the
whole of this wicked world."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then what, madam, induces you to tell these absurd stories to me, and to
talk about your riches, when you know that you and your daughters are
beggars, ma'am—<em>beggars</em>?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"My dearest boy, have we not got the house, and the furniture, and a hundred
a year still; and have you not great talents which will make all our
fortunes?" says Mrs. Stubbs, getting up off her knees, and making believe to
smile as she clawed hold of my hand and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was <em>too</em> cool. "<em>You</em> have got a hundred a year, ma'am," says I, "<em>you</em>
got a house: upon my soul and honour this is the first I ever heard of it, and
I'll tell you what, ma'am," says I (and it cut her <em>pretty sharply</em> too), "as you've
got it, <em>you'd better go and live in it</em>. I've got quite enough to do with my own
house, and every penny of my own income."</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this speech the old lady said nothing, but she gave a screech loud
enough to be heard from here to York, and down she fell—kicking and struggling
in a regular fit.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>I did not see Mrs. Stubbs for some days after this, and the girls used to
come down to meals, and never speak; going up again and stopping with
their mother. At last, one day, both of them came in very solemn to my
study, and Eliza, the eldest, said, "Robert, mamma has paid you our board
up to Michaelmas."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She has," says I; for I always took precious good care to have it in advance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She says, John, that on Michaelmas day we'll—we'll go away, John."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, she's going to her own house, is she, Lizzy? very good; she'll want the
furniture, I suppose, and that she may have, too, for I'm going to sell the place
myself;" and so <em>that</em> matter was settled.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>On Michaelmas day, and during these two months, I hadn't, I do believe,
seen my mother twice (once, about two o'clock in the morning, I woke and
found her sobbing over my bed). On Michaelmas day morning, Eliza comes to
me and says, "<em>John, they will come and fetch us at six this evening.</em>" Well, as
this was the last day, I went and got the best goose I could find (I don't think
I ever saw a primer, or ate more hearty myself), and had it roasted at three,
with a good pudding afterwards; and a glorious bowl of punch. "Here's a
health to you, dear girls," says I, "and you, ma, and good luck to all three, and
as you've not eaten a morsel, I hope you wont object to a glass of punch. It's
the old stuff, you know, ma'am, that that Waters sent to my father fifteen
years ago."</p>

<p class='c000'>Six o'clock came, and with it came a fine barouche, as I live! Captain
Waters was on the box (it was his coach); that old thief, Bates, jumped out,
entered my house, and before I could say Jack Robinson, whipped off mamma
to the carriage, the girls followed, just giving me a hasty shake of the hand,
and as mamma was helped in, Mary Waters, who was sitting inside, flung her
arms round her, and then round the girls, and the Doctor, who acted footman,
jumped on the box, and off they went; taking no more notice of <em>me</em> than if I'd
been a nonentity.</p>

<p class='c000'>There's the picture of the whole business: That's mamma and Miss Waters
sitting kissing each other in the carriage, with the two girls in the back seat;
Waters driving (a precious bad driver he is, too); and that's me, standing at
the garden door, and whistling. You can't see Mary Malowney; the old fool
is crying behind the garden gate: she went off next day along with the furniture;
and I got into that precious scrape which I shall mention next.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>SEPTEMBER.—<span class='sc'>Plucking a Goose.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>After my papa's death, as he left me no money, and only a little land, I put
my estate into an auctioneer's hands, and determined to amuse my solitude
with a trip to some of our fashionable watering-places. My house was now a
desert to me. I need not say how the departure of my dear parent, and her
children, left me sad and lonely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I had a little ready money, and, for the estate, expected a couple of
thousand pounds. I had a good military-looking person; for though I had
absolutely cut the old North-Bungays (indeed, after my affair with Waters,
Colonel Craw hinted to me, in the most friendly manner, that I had better
resign), though I had left the army, I still retained the rank of Captain; knowing
the advantages attendant upon that title, in a watering-place tour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Stubbs became a great dandy at Cheltenham, Harrogate, Bath,
Leamington, and other places. I was a good whist and billiard-player; so
much so, that in many of these towns the people used to refuse, at last, to play
with me, knowing how far I was their superior. Fancy, my surprise, about
five years after the Portsmouth affair, when strolling one day up the High
Street, in Leamington, my eyes lighted upon a young man, whom I remembered
in a certain butcher's yard, and elsewhere—no other, in fact, than Dobble.
He, too, was dressed <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en militaire</span></i>, with a frogged coat and spurs; and was walking
with a showy-looking, Jewish-faced, black-haired lady, glittering with chains
and rings, with a green bonnet, and a bird of Paradise—a lilac shawl, a yellow
gown, pink silk stockings, and light blue shoes. Three children, and a handsome
footman, were walking behind her, and the party, not seeing me, entered
the Royal Hotel together.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was known, myself, at the Royal, and calling one of the waiters, learned the
names of the lady and gentleman. He was Captain Dobble, the son of the
rich army clothier, Dobble (Dobble, Hobble, and Co., of Pall Mall); the lady
was a Mrs. Manasseh, widow of an American Jew, living quietly at Leamington
with her children, but possessed of an immense property. There's no use
to give one's self out to be an absolute pauper, so the fact is, that I myself went
everywhere with the character of a man of very large means. My father had
died, leaving me immense sums of money, and landed estates—ah! I was the
gentleman then, the real gentleman, and everybody was too happy to have me
at table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I came the next day, and left a card for Dobble, with a note: he
neither returned my visit, nor answered my note. The day after, however, I
met him with the widow, as before; and, going up to him, very kindly seized
him by the hand, and swore I was—as really was the case—charmed to see
him. Dobble hung back, to my surprise, and I do believe the creature would
have cut me, if he dared; but I gave him a frown, and said—</p>

<p class='c000'>"What, Dobble, my boy, don't you recollect old Stubbs, and our adventure
with the butcher's daughters, ha?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Dobble gave me a sickly kind of grin, and said, "Oh! ah! yes! It is—yes!
it is, I believe, Captain Stubbs."</p>

<p class='c000'>"An old comrade, madam, of Captain Dobble's, and one who has heard so
much, and seen so much, of your ladyship, that he must take the liberty of
begging his friend to introduce him."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dobble was obliged to take the hint; and Captain Stubbs was duly presented
to Mrs. Manasseh; the lady was as gracious as possible: and when, at the end
of the walk, we parted, she said, "she hoped Captain Dobble would bring me
to her apartments that evening, where she expected a few friends." Everybody,
you see, knows everybody at Leamington; and I, for my part, was well
known as a retired officer of the army; who, on his father's death, had come
into seven thousand a year. Dobble's arrival had been subsequent to mine,
but putting up, as he did, at the Royal Hotel, and dining at the ordinary there
with the widow, he had made his acquaintance before I had. I saw, however,
that if I allowed him to talk about me, as he could, I should be compelled to
give up all my hopes and pleasures at Leamington; and so I determined to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>be short with him. As soon as the lady had gone into the hotel, my friend
Dobble was for leaving me likewise; but I stopped him, and said, "Mr.
Dobble, I saw what you meant just now: you wanted to cut me, because, forsooth,
I did not choose to fight a duel at Portsmouth; now look you, Dobble,
I am no hero, but I'm not such a coward as you—and you know it. You are
a very different man to deal with from Waters; and <em>I will fight</em> this time."</p>

<p class='c000'>Not, perhaps, that I would: but after the business of the butcher, I knew
Dobble to be as great a coward as ever lived: and there never was any harm in
threatening, for you know you are not obliged to stick to it afterwards. My
words had their effect upon Dobble, who stuttered, and looked red, and then declared,
he never had the slightest intention of passing me by; so we became
friends, and his mouth was stopped.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was very thick with the widow: but that lady had a very capacious heart,
and there were a number of other gentlemen who seemed equally smitten with
her. "Look at that Mrs. Manasseh," said a gentleman (it was droll, <em>he</em> was a
Jew, too), sitting at dinner by me; "she is old and ugly, and yet because she
has money, all the men are flinging themselves at her."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She has money, has she?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Eighty thousand pounds, and twenty thousand for each of her children. I
know it <em>for a fact</em>," said the strange gentleman. "I am in the law, and we, of our
faith, you know, know pretty well what the great families amongst us are worth."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who was Mr. Manasseh?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A man of enormous wealth—a tobacco-merchant—West Indies; a fellow of
no birth, however; and who, between ourselves, married a woman that is not
much better than she should be. My dear sir," whispered he, "she is always in
love—now it is with that Captain Dobble; last week it was somebody else; and
it may be you next week, if—ha! ha! ha!—you are disposed to enter the lists."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wouldn't, for <em>my</em> part, have the woman with twice her money."</p>

<p class='c000'>What did it matter to me, whether the woman was good or not, provided she
was rich? My course was quite clear. I told Dobble all that this gentleman
had informed me, and being a pretty good hand at making a story, I made the
widow appear <em>so</em> bad, that the poor fellow was quite frightened, and fairly quitted
the field. Ha! ha! I'm dashed if I did not make him believe that Mrs. Manasseh
had <em>murdered</em> her last husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>I played my game so well, thanks to the information that my friend the
lawyer had given me, that, in a month, I had got the widow to show a most
decided partiality for me. I sat by her at dinner; I drank with her at the Wells;
I rode with her; I danced with her; and at a pic-nic to Kenilworth, where we
drank a good deal of champagne, I actually popped the question, and was accepted.
In another month, Robert Stubbs, Esq., led to the altar Leah, widow
of the late Z. Manasseh, Esq., of St. Kitt's!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>We drove up to London in her comfortable chariot; the children and servants
following in a post-chaise. I paid, of course, for everything; and until our house
in Berkeley Square was painted, we stopped at Stevens's Hotel.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>My own estate had been sold, and the money was lying at a bank, in the city.
About three days after our arrival, as we took our breakfast in the hotel, previous
to a visit to Mrs. Stubbs's banker, where certain little transfers were to be made,
a gentleman was introduced, who, I saw at a glance, was of my wife's persuasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at Mrs. Stubbs, and made a bow. "Perhaps it will be convenient
to you to pay this little bill, one hundred and fifty-two poundsh?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"My love," says she, "will you pay this? It is a trifle which I had really
forgotten." "My soul!" said I, "I have really not the money in the house."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vel, denn, Captain Shtubbsh," says he, "I must do my duty—and arrest
you—here is the writ! Tom, keep the door!"—My wife fainted—the children
screamed, and I—fancy my condition, as I was obliged to march off to a sponging
house, along with a horrid sheriff's officer!</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>I shall not describe my feelings when I found myself in a cage in Cursitor-street,
instead of that fine house in Berkeley Square, which was to have been mine as the
husband of Mrs. Manasseh. What a palace!—in an odious, dismal street leading
from Chancery Lane,—a hideous Jew boy opened the second of three doors; and shut
it when Mr. Nabb and I (almost fainting) had entered: then he opened the third door,
and then I was introduced to a filthy place, called a coffee-room, which I exchanged
for the solitary comfort of a little dingy back-parlour, where I was left for a while
to brood over my miserable fate. Fancy the change between this and Berkeley
Square! Was I, after all my pains, and cleverness, and perseverance, cheated at
last? Had this Mrs. Manasseh been imposing upon me, and were the words of
the wretch I met at the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table-d'hôte</span></i> at Leamington, only meant to mislead me and
take me in? I determined to send for my wife, and know the whole truth. I
saw at once that I had been the victim of an infernal plot, and that the carriage,
the house in town, the West India fortune, were only so many lies which I had
blindly believed. It was true the debt was but a hundred and fifty pounds: and
I had two thousand at my bankers. But was the loss of <em>her</em> £80,000 nothing?
Was the destruction of my hopes nothing?—The accursed addition to my family of
a Jewish wife, and three Jewish children, nothing? And all these I was to
support out of my two thousand pounds. I had better have stopped at home, with
my mamma and sisters, whom I really did love, and who produced me eighty
pounds a-year.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had a furious interview with Mrs. Stubbs; and when I charged her, the base
wretch! with cheating me, like a brazen serpent, as she was, she flung back the
cheat in my teeth, and swore I had swindled her. Why did I marry her, when
she might have had twenty others? She only took me, she said, because I had
twenty thousand pounds. I <em>had</em> said I possessed that sum; but in love, you
know, and war, all's fair.</p>

<p class='c000'>We parted quite as angrily as we met; and I cordially vowed that when I had
paid the debt into which I had been swindled by her, I would take my £2,000,
and depart to some desert island; or, at the very least, to America, and never see
her more, or any of her Israelitish brood. There was no use in remaining in the
sponging-house (for I knew that there were such things as detainers, and that where
Mrs. Stubbs owed a hundred pounds, she might owe a thousand), so I sent for Mr.
Nabb, and tendering him a cheque for £150, and his costs, requested to be let out
forthwith. "Here, fellow," said I, "is a cheque on Child's for your paltry sum."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It may be a shech on Shild's," says Mr. Nabb, "but I should be a baby to let
you out on such a paper as dat."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well," said I, "Child's is but a step from this; you may go and get the cash,—just
giving me an acknowledgment."</p>

<p class='c000'>Nabb drew out the acknowledgment with great punctuality, and set off for the
Bankers, whilst I prepared myself for departure from this abominable prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled as he came in. "Well," said I, "you have touched your money;
and now, I must tell you, that you are the most infernal rogue and extortioner I
ever met with."</p>

<p class='c000'>"O no, mishter Shtubbsh," says he, grinning still, "dere is som greater roag
dan me,—mosh greater."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Fellow," says I, "don't stand grinning before a gentleman; but give me my
hat and cloak, and let me leave your filthy den."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Shtop, Shtubbsh," says he, not even Mistering me this time, "here ish a letter,
vich you had better read."</p>

<p class='c000'>I opened the letter: something fell to the ground:—it was my cheque.</p>

<p class='c000'>The letter ran thus: "Messrs. Child and Co. present their compliments to
Captain Stubbs, and regret that they have been obliged to refuse payment of the
enclosed, having been served this day with an attachment by Messrs. Solomonson
and Co., which compels them to retain Captain Stubbs's balance of £2010 11<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>
until the decision of the suit of Solomonson v. Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Fleet Street."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You see," says Mr. Nabb, as I read this dreadful letter, "you see, Shtubbsh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>dere vas two debts,—a littel von, and a big von. So dey arrested you for de
littel von, and attashed your money for de big von."</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>Don't laugh at me for telling this story: if you knew what tears are blotting
over the paper as I write it; if you knew that for weeks after I was more like a
madman than a sane man,—a madman in the Fleet Prison, where I went, instead
of to the desert island. What had I done to deserve it? Hadn't I always kept an
eye to the main chance? Hadn't I lived economically, and not like other young
men? Had I ever been known to squander or give away a single penny? No!
I can lay my hand on my heart, and, thank Heaven, say, No! Why—why was
I punished so?</p>

<p class='c000'>Let me conclude this miserable history. Seven months—my wife saw me once
or twice, and then dropped me altogether—I remained in that fatal place. I wrote
to my dear mamma, begging her to sell her furniture, but got no answer. All my
old friends turned their backs upon me. My action went against me—I had not
a penny to defend it. Solomonson proved my wife's debt, and seized my two
thousand pounds.—As for the detainer against me, I was obliged to go through
the court for the relief of insolvent debtors. I passed through it, and came out a
beggar. But, fancy the malice of that wicked Stiffelkind; he appeared in court
as my creditor for £3, with sixteen years' interest, at five per cent., for a <span class='fss'>PAIR OF
TOP-BOOTS</span>. The old thief produced them in court, and told the whole story—Lord
Cornwallis, the detection, the pumping, and all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Commissioner Dubobwig was very funny about it. "So Doctor Swishtail would
not pay you for the boots, eh, Mr. Stiffelkind?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No; he said, ven I ask him for payment, dey was ordered by a yong boy, and
I ought to have gone to his schoolmaster."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What, then, you came on a <em>bootless</em> errand, eh, sir?" (A laugh.)</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bootless! no, sare. I brought de boots back vid me; how de devil else could I
show dem to you?" (Another laugh.)</p>

<p class='c000'>"You've never <em>soled</em> 'em since, Mr. Tickleshins?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I never vood sell dem; I svore I never vood, on porpus to be revenged on dat
Stobbs."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What, your wound has never been <em>healed</em>, eh?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vat do you mean vid your bootless errants, and your soling and healing? I
tell you I have done vat I svore to do; I have exposed him at school, I have
broak off a marriage for him, ven he vould have had twenty tousand pound, and
now I have showed him up in a court of justice; dat is vat I ave done, and dat's
enough." And then the old wretch went down, whilst everybody was giggling
and staring at poor me—as if I was not miserable enough already.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This seems the dearest pair of boots you ever had in your life, Mr. Stubbs,"
said Commissioner Dubobwig, very archly, and then he began to inquire about the
rest of my misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fulness of my heart I told him the whole of them; how Mr. Solomonson
the attorney had introduced me to the rich widow, Mrs. Manasseh, who had fifty
thousand pounds, and an estate in the West Indies. How I was married, and
arrested on coming to town, and cast in an action for two thousand pounds,
brought against me by this very Solomonson for my wife's debts.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stop," says a lawyer in the court. "Is this woman a showy black-haired
woman, with one eye? very often drunk, with three children—Solomonson, short,
with red hair?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Exactly so," says I, with tears in my eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That woman has married <em>three men</em> within the last two years. One in Ireland,
and one at Bath. A Solomonson is, I believe, her husband, and they both are off
for America ten days ago."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But why did you not keep your £2000?" said the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sir, they attached it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"O! well, we may pass you; you have been unlucky, Mr. Stubbs, but it seems as
if the biter had been bit in this affair."</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," said Mr. Dubobwig, "Mr. Stubbs is the victim of a FATAL ATTACHMENT."</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>NOVEMBER.—<span class='sc'>A General Post Delivery.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I was a free man when I went out of the Court; but I was a beggar—I, Captain
Stubbs, of the bold North-Bungays, did not know where I could get a bed or a
dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street, I felt a hand on my shoulder,
and a rough voice which I knew well.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vell, Mr. Stobbs, have I not kept my bromise? I told you dem boots would
be your ruin."</p>

<p class='c000'>I was much too miserable to reply; and only cast up my eyes towards the roofs
of the houses, which I could not see for the tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vat! you begin to gry and blobber like a shild? you vood marry, vood you, and
noting vood do for you but a vife vid monny—ha, ha—but you vere de pigeon,
and she vas de grow. She has plocked you, too, pretty vell—eh? ha! ha!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Mr. Stiffelkind," said I, "don't laugh at my misery; she has not left me a
single shilling under heaven. And I shall starve—I do believe I shall starve."
And I began to cry fit to break my heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Starf! stoff and nonsense—you vil never die of starfing—you vil die of <em>hanging</em>,
I tink, ho! ho! and it is moch easier vay too." I didn't say a word, but cried on,
till everybody in the street turned round and stared.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Come, come," said Stiffelkind, "do not gry, Gaptain Stobbs—it is not goot for
a Gaptain to gry, ha! ha! Dere, come vid me, and you shall have a dinner, and a
bregfast too—vich shall gost you nothing, until you can bay vid your earnings."</p>

<p class='c000'>And so this curious old man, who had persecuted me all through my prosperity,
grew compassionate towards me in my ill-luck: and took me home with him as he
promised. "I saw your name among de Insolvents—and I vowed, you know, to
make you repent dem boots. Dere now, it is done and forgotten, look you. Here,
Betty, Bettchen, make de spare bed, and put a clean knife and fork; Lort Cornvallis
is come to dine vid me."</p>

<p class='c000'>I lived with this strange old man for six weeks. I kept his books, and did
what little I could to make myself useful: carrying about boots and shoes, as if I
had never borne his Majesty's commission. He gave me no money, but he fed
and lodged me comfortably. The men and boys used to laugh, and call me
General, and Lord Cornwallis, and all sorts of nicknames—and old Stiffelkind
made a thousand new ones for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, I can recollect—one miserable day, as I was polishing on the trees a
pair of boots of Mr. Stiffelkind's manufacture, the old gentleman came into the shop
with a lady on his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vere is Gaptain Stobbs," says he; "vere is dat ornament to his Majesty's service?"</p>

<p class='c000'>I came in from the back shop, where I was polishing the boots, with one of them
in my hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Look, my dear," says he, "here is an old friend of yours, his Excellency Lord
Cornvallis! Who would have thought such a nobleman vood turn shoe-black?
Gaptain Stobbs, here is your former flame, my dear niece, Miss Grotty. How could
you, Magdalen, ever leaf soch a lof of a man? Shake hands vid her, Gaptain;—dere,
never mind de blacking:" but Miss drew back.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I never shake hands with a <em>shoe-black</em>," says she, mighty contemptuous.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bah! my lof, his fingers von't soil you. Don't you know he has just been <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vite-vashed</span></i>?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish, uncle," says she, "you would not leave me with such low people."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Low, because he cleans boots? de Gaptain prefers <em>pumps</em> to boots, I tink,
ha! ha!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Captain, indeed! a nice Captain," says Miss Crutty, snapping her fingers in
my face, and walking away: "a Captain, who has had his nose pulled? ha! ha!"—And
how could I help it? it wasn't by my own <em>choice</em> that that ruffian Waters
took such liberties with me; didn't I show how averse I was to all quarrels by
refusing altogether his challenge?—but such is the world: and thus the people at
Stiffelkind's used to tease me until they drove me almost mad.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>At last, he came home one day more merry and abusive than ever. "Gaptain,"
says he, "I have goot news for you—a goot place. Your lortship vil not be able
to geep your garridge, but you vil be gomfortable, and serve his Majesty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Serve his Majesty!" says I. "Dearest Mr. Stiffelkind, have you got me a place
under Government?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, and someting better still—not only a place, but a uniform—yes, Gabdain
Stobbs, a <em>red goat</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A red coat! I hope you don't think I would demean myself by entering the
ranks of the army? I am a gentleman, Mr. Stiffelkind—I can never—no, I never."</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, I know you will never—you are too great a goward, ha! ha!—though dis
is a red goat, and a place where you must give some <em>hard knocks</em> too, ha! ha!—do
you gomprehend?—and you shall be a general, instead of a gabtain—ha! ha!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A general in a red coat! Mr. Stiffelkind?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, a GENERAL BOSTMAN! ha! ha! I have been vid your old friend,
Bunting, and he has an uncle in the Post-office, and he has got you de place—eighteen
shillings a veek, you rogue, and your goat. You must not oben any of
de letters, you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>And so it was—I, Robert Stubbs, Esquire, became the vile thing he named—a
general postman!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>I was so disgusted with Stiffelkind's brutal jokes, which were now more brutal
than ever, that when I got my place in the Post-office I never went near the
fellow again—for though he had done me a favour in keeping me from starvation,
he certainly had done it in a very rude, disagreeable manner, and showed a low
and mean spirit in <em>shoving</em> me into such a degraded place as that of postman. But
what had I to do? I submitted to fate, and for three years or more, Robert Stubbs,
of the North-Bungay Fencibles, was——</p>

<p class='c000'>I wonder nobody recognised me. I lived in daily fear the first year; but, afterwards,
grew accustomed to my situation, as all great men will do, and wore my
red coat as naturally as if I had been sent into the world only for the purpose of
being a letter carrier.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was first in the Whitechapel district, where I stayed nearly three years, when
I was transferred to Jermyn Street and Duke Street—famous places for lodgings.
I suppose I left a hundred letters at a house in the latter street, where lived some
people who must have recognised me had they but once chanced to look at me.</p>

<p class='c000'>You see, that when I left Sloffem, and set out in the gay world, my mamma had
written to me a dozen times at least, but I never answered her, for I knew she
wanted money, and I detest writing. Well, she stopped her letters, finding she
could get none from me: but when I was in the Fleet, as I told you, I wrote
repeatedly to my dear mamma, and was not a little nettled at her refusing to
notice me in my distress, which is the very time one most wants notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stubbs is not an uncommon name; and though I saw MRS. STUBBS on a little
bright brass plate, in Duke Street, and delivered so many letters to the lodgers in her
house, I never thought of asking who she was, or whether she was my relation, or not.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day the young woman who took in the letters had not got change, and she
called her mistress;—an old lady in a poke bonnet came out of the parlour, and
put on her spectacles, and looked at the letter, and fumbled in her pocket for
eight-pence, and apologized to the postman for keeping him waiting; and when I
said, "Never mind, ma'am, it's no trouble," the old lady gave a start, and then she
pulled off her spectacles, and staggered back; and then she began muttering, as
if about to choke; and then she gave a great screech, and flung herself into my
arms, and roared out, "MY SON! MY SON!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Law, mamma," said I, "is that you?" and I sat down on the hall bench with
her, and let her kiss me as much as ever she liked. Hearing the whining and
crying, down comes another lady from upstairs,—it was my sister Eliza; and
down come the lodgers. And the maid gets water, and what not, and I was the
regular hero of the group. I could not stay long then, having my letters to
deliver. But, in the evening, after mail-time, I went back to my mamma and
sister: and, over a bottle of prime old Port, and a precious good leg of boiled
mutton and turnips, made myself pretty comfortable, I can tell you.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of false prophets, who predict of the times, which,
but for thy simplicity, would be for them "out of joint"—of
the seasons, of which they know not, save that they yield them a
profitable harvest,—and of the winds, for which they care not, so
that they blow them good; but turn from them awhile, and regard
the Hieroglyphicum in Obscuro I here set before thee, and the interpretation
thereof; and, if it come not as I predict, thou may'st
guess the reason why. Unlucky planets rule the State Kitchen;
and the great kettle being filled by Aquarius, with Sol in opposition,
an unfriendly boil is produced, which maketh the place so
hot that the Cooks find it hard to stay within, though loth to go
out. Moreover, being of one mind as to the making of <em>a mess</em>,
but differing as to the manner thereof, they have fallen to fighting,
to settle the question, and are all going to pot together. By a
touch of my wand, behold them transmogrified into a <em>Lamb's head</em>,
served with a plentiful dressing of strong <em>Durham</em> mustard, a
<em>little Jack</em> clinging to the side, as though he wished himself out of
this pretty kettle of fish, and a fowl, though, by his looks, no
chicken, attempting his escape in the form of a winged <em>Cupid</em>. He
does not like his company, and has made his bow—behold it in his
hand. Another fish, more like a <em>Sir John</em> than a sturgeon, seems
as though his berth was far from pleasant. The Mistress, alarmed
by the noise, comes to the window to see what is the matter; an
ancient Master Cook, from <em>Arthur's</em>, stands, ladle in hand, his
fingers itching to skim the scum off as it rises. An old Kitchen
Maid, who, though pensioned off, will still have a finger in every
pie, hath been stirring the fire with a worn-out <em>broom</em>-handle, (perchance
she hath slyly put in a pinch of gunpowder) and is now
playing the part of blow-bellows. She seemeth, by the satisfactionated
curl of her nose, to be happy to see them all in hot
water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, as to the application hereof, every man must judge for
himself; but of a verity it doth to me appear, that too many
cooks will spoil any broth. And, while I speak of cookery, let
me advise thee as to thy treatment of that which a departed
wiseacre denominated the "worse than useless root." If, rejecting
his advice, none but this fruit will content thee, let me
counsel thee to follow my example—having well roasted my
Murphy, I take him "<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cum grano salis</span></i>." Now, touching other
mundane matters, thou wilt herein find copious instructions, sage

  <h3 class='c007'>DECEMBER.—"<span class='sc'>The Winter of our Discontent.</span>"</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mamma had kept the house in Duke Street for more than two years. I recollected
some of the chairs and tables, from dear old Squiggle, and the bowl in
which I had made that famous rum-punch, the evening she went away, which she
and my sisters left untouched, and I was obliged to drink after they were gone;
but that's not to the purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Think of my sister Mary's luck! That chap, Waters, fell in love with her,
and married her; and she now keeps her carriage, and lives in state near Squiggle.
I offered to make it up with Waters; but he bears malice, and never will see or
speak to me. He had the impudence, too, to say that he took in all letters for
mamma at Squiggle; and that, as mine were all begging letters, he burned them,
and never said a word to her concerning them. He allowed mamma fifty pounds
a year, and, if she were not such a fool, she might have had three times as much;
but the old lady was high and mighty, forsooth, and would not be beholden, even
to her own daughter, for more than she actually wanted. Even this fifty pounds
she was going to refuse; but when I came to live with her, of course I wanted
pocket money as well as board and lodging, and so I had the fifty pounds for <em>my</em>
share, and eked out with it as well as I could.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Bates and the Captain, between them, gave mamma a hundred pounds
when she left me (she had the deuce's own luck, to be sure—much more than ever
fell to <em>me</em>, I know), and as she said she <em>would</em> try and work for her living, it was
thought best to take a house and let lodgings, which she did. Our first and second
floor paid us four guineas a week, on an average; and the front parlour and attic
made forty pounds more. Mamma and Eliza used to have the front attic; but <em>I</em>
took that, and they slept in the servants' bed room. Lizzy had a pretty genius
for work, and earned a guinea a week that way; so that we had got nearly two
hundred a year over the rent to keep house with,—and we got on pretty well.
Besides, women eat nothing; my women didn't care for meat for days together
sometimes,—so that it was only necessary to dress a good steak or so for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mamma would not think of my continuing in the Post-office. She said her dear
John, her husband's son, her gallant soldier, and all that, should remain at home,
and be a gentleman—which I was, certainly, though I didn't find fifty pounds a year
very much to buy clothes and be a gentleman upon; to be sure, mother found me
shirts and linen, so that <em>that</em> wasn't in the fifty pounds. She kicked a little at
paying the washing too; but she gave in at last, for I was her dear John, you
know; and I'm blest if I could not make her give me the gown off her back.
Fancy! once she cut up a very nice rich black silk scarf, which my sister Waters
sent her, and made me a waistcoat and two stocks of it. She was so <em>very</em> soft,
the old lady!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>I'd lived in this way for five years or more, making myself content with my
fifty pounds a year (<em>perhaps</em>, I'd saved a little out of it; but that's neither here nor
there). From year's end to year's end I remained faithful to my dear mamma,
never leaving her except for a month or so in summer, when a bachelor may take
a trip to Gravesend or Margate, which would be too expensive for a family. I say
a bachelor, for the fact is, I don't know whether I am married or not—never
having heard a word since of the scoundrelly Mrs. Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>I never went to the public house before meals; for, with my beggarly fifty
pounds, I could not afford to dine away from home; but there I had my regular
seat, and used to come home <em>pretty glorious</em>, I can tell you. Then, bed till eleven;
then, breakfast and the newspaper; then, a stroll in Hyde Park or Saint James's;
then, home at half-past three to dinner, when I jollied, as I call it, for the rest
of the day. I was my mother's delight; and thus, with a clear conscience, I
managed to live on.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>How fond she was of me, to be sure! Being sociable myself, and loving to have
my friends about me, we often used to assemble a company of as hearty fellows as
you would wish to sit down with, and keep the nights up royally. "Never mind,
my boys," I used to say, "send the bottle round: mammy pays for all," as she did,
sure enough; and sure enough we punished her cellar too. The good old lady
used to wait upon us, as if for all the world she had been my servant, instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>a lady and my mamma. Never used she to repine, though I often, as I must confess,
gave her occasion (keeping her up till four o'clock in the morning, because
she never could sleep until she saw her "dear Bob" in bed, and leading her a sad
anxious life). She was of such a sweet temper, the old lady, that I think in the
course of five years I never knew her in a passion, except twice; and then with
sister Lizzy, who declared I was ruining the house, and driving the lodgers away,
one by one. But mamma would not hear of such envious spite on my sister's
part. "Her Bob" was always right, she said. At last Lizzy fairly retreated, and
went to the Waterses,—I was glad of it, for her temper was dreadful, and we used
to be squabbling from morning till night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ah, those <em>were</em> jolly times! but ma was obliged to give up the lodging-house at
last—for, somehow, things went wrong after my sister's departure—the nasty uncharitable
people said, on account of <em>me</em>; because I drove away the lodgers by
smoking and drinking, and kicking up noises in the house; and because mamma
gave me so much of her money:—so she did, but if she <em>would</em> give it, you know,
how could I help it? Heigho! I wish I'd <em>kept</em> it.</p>

<p class='c000'>No such luck.—The business I thought was to last for ever; but at the end of
two years a smash came—shut up shop—sell off everything. Mamma went to
the Waterses: and, will you believe it, the ungrateful wretches would not receive
me! that Mary, you see, was <em>so</em> disappointed at not marrying me. Twenty pounds
a year they allow, it is true; but what's that for a gentleman? For twenty years
I have been struggling manfully to gain an honest livelihood, and, in the course
of them, have seen a deal of life, to be sure. I've sold segars and pocket-hand-kerchiefs
at the corners of streets; I've been a billiard-marker; I've been Director
(in the panic year) of the Imperial British Consolidated Mangle and Drying
Ground Company. I've been on the stage (for two years as an actor, and about a
month as a cad, when I was very low); I've been the means of giving to the
police of this empire some very valuable information (about licensed victuallers,
gentlemen's carts, and pawnbrokers' names); I've been very nearly an officer again—that
is, an assistant to an officer of the Sheriff of Middlesex: it was my last place.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the last day of the year 1837, even <em>that</em> game was up. It's a thing that has
very seldom happened to a gentleman, to be kicked out of a sponging-house; but
such was my case. Young Nabbs (who succeeded his father) drove me ignominiously
from his door, because I had charged a gentleman in the coffee-rooms
seven-and-sixpence for a glass of ale and bread and cheese, the charge of the
house being only six shillings. He had the meanness to deduct the eighteen-pence
from my wages, and, because I blustered a bit, he took me by the shoulders and
turned me out—me, a gentleman, and, what is more, a poor orphan!</p>

<p class='c000'>How I did rage and swear at him when I got out in the street!—There stood
he, the hideous Jew monster, at the double door, writhing under the effect of my
language. I had my revenge! Heads were thrust out of every bar of his windows,
laughing at him. A crowd gathered round me, as I stood pounding him
with my satire, and they evidently enjoyed his discomfiture. I think the mob
would have pelted the ruffian to death (one or two of their missiles hit <em>me</em>, I can
tell you), when a policeman came up, and, in reply to a gentleman, who was asking
what was the disturbance, said, "Bless you, Sir, it's Lord Cornwallis." "Move
on, <em>Boots</em>," said the fellow to me, for, the fact is, my misfortunes and early life are
pretty well known—and so the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What could have made that policeman call you Lord Cornwallis and Boots?"
said the gentleman, who seemed mightily amused, and had followed me. "Sir,"
says I, "I am an unfortunate officer of the North Bungay Fencibles, and I'll tell
you willingly for a pint of beer." He told me to follow him to his chambers at
the Temple, which I did (a five pair back), and there, sure enough, I had the beer;
and told him this very story you've been reading. You see he is what is called a
literary man—and sold my adventures for me to the booksellers: he's a strange
chap; and says they're <em>moral</em>.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>I'm blest if I can see anything moral in them. I'm sure I ought to have been
more lucky through life, being so very wide awake. And yet here I am, without
a place, or even a friend, starving upon a beggarly twenty pounds a year—not a
single sixpence more, upon <em>my honour</em>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>ASCOT CUP DAY.<br /> FROM THE RACING CALENDAR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>"Well, I never!—this the Great Western Railway: the
Paddington Station? What a beautiful place:—ugh! ugh! ugh!—and
that's the engine: did I ever!—What a funny noise it
makes; and what elegant carriages—all plate-glass and silk-lace!"
Thus rattled a lively little matron, as fine as a milliner's pattern-doll,
to her dapper lord and master, as they seated themselves
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span></i>, in the nine-o'clock down train, first-class, on the morning
of the last anniversary of Ascot Cup Day. Anon they were
darting onwards for their destination, and again the dame's loquacities
were at high pressure. "It is charming, and that's all
about it: for all the world like travelling by balloon; and as free
from dust and dirt as if one was borne through the air. Why, we
shall get down, I <em>do</em> declare, as clean as new pins." "No danger
of being soiled on <em>this</em> line, marm," remarked a stout personage
in nankeen leggings, a wig, and a <em>very</em> red face, "'cause why, we
escape <em>Staines</em> and avoid <em>Slough</em>, you know: ha! ha!"</p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of five-and-forty minutes, bump, bump, bump,
and a hissing, as of a universe of boa-constrictors, were succeeded
by the interrogatory, from officials in green and much brass, of—"Now
Windsor?" and all the crew bound for the races descended
<em>of course</em>. Then rose the clamour of 'bus cads and go-cart
touters—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Billingsgate eloquence, and, as I guess,</div>
      <div class='line'>The logic of the 'os coccygis;'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>when, after a scuffle, and some energetic demonstrations, our little
dame and second-self found themselves once more in company
with the gentleman in the leggings and red face. The trio were
seated in a lateral inconvenience on enormous wheels, the
charioteer, with his behind before them, urging to utmost speed a
gaunt but sinewy bit of blood, who flew onwards as if a herd of
hungry wolves were at his haunches. Our travellers were soon
on the best of terms: good fellowship generally results when
people are thus <em>thrown together</em>. Windsor was quickly reached,
and as they turned the corner beyond the White Hart, which
leads to Ascot, an equipage at the door of the hostelry attracted,
by its splendour, the go-carter's attention. "That's L——'s
carriage," said the married male; "he that cut such a dash last
season; gave balls to one half of London;"—"and <em>rifled</em> the
other," rejoined the man with the rosy countenance: it was manifest
that he was a wag. "A correct list of all the wonderful high-bred
horses, and how they will come in for every heat during the
day." "The modern Hercules, ladies and gentlemen; <em>the</em> modern
Hercules: he will take and tie that ere donkey to this here ladder,
and balance the <em>as</em>tonishing <em>con</em>junction on the tip of his nose.
Waiting for a ha'penny, ladies and gentlemen; make it another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>brown, and—up—he—goes." Such is the chorus of the Olympic
song, chanted what time Ascot celebrates her right-royal revels;
but we tarry not for the ladder, or <em>the staves</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through streets of <em>canvas</em> caravanseras, all <em>soliciting</em> their
custom, our <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tria juncta</span></i> reach <em>the ropes</em> as the word runs along <em>the
lines</em>, "The Queen is coming!" "Let me see her," ejaculated
the lady voyager: "bless her heart! it was for that I came here;
and is that Her Majesty? She is a darling, that's what she is!
so amiable, so kind-looking, and so little to be a queen!" "And
who is that in green, with the costly golden couples over his
shoulders?" "Oh, that's the master of the <em>dear</em> hounds." "And
all those lovely, smiling ladies?" "More of the <em>sweet</em>." "Clear <em>the
course</em>, clear <em>the course</em>!" and straightway there is a movement of
gold, precious stones, silk, and paradise plumes, enough to astonish
the Genii of the Wonderful Lamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here they come!" Grey Momus, and Epirus, and Caravan,
with "little Pavis, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rara avis</span></i>." "Another round for it. Well
done, grey; hurrah! dismal jacket." "Who's the favourite?"
"The <em>belles</em> are all for <em>Bowes</em>; I'm for Suffield, he's such a good
fellow." "I'm for Lord George, <em>he's a better</em>." "Hurrah! splendid
race." "Oh! you villain, you've stolen my watch; but I've
got you, and I'll give it you." "That ere's never no prigging.
Didn't I hear you promise to give it him?" "Get away, do—you'll
break the springs: you're not to climb up my steps for a stare."
The Royal Stand is now vacated, and the cause reaches our little
inquisitive friend. "Her Majesty has retired to luncheon." "Law,
is she, indeed! how I <em>should</em> like to see her eat: I'm dying to
know what sort of meals they provide for her." "All the delicacies
in season," explained the wit, with a sinister smile, "and
<em>Lamb</em> the whole year round." The matchless cavalcade has
passed in all its gorgeous simplicity, bearing the cynosure of all
eyes, where waves the banner of St. George a welcome to</p>

<p class='c000'>This, and a rain, descending <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'Anglaise</span></i>, gave notice to quit to all
save those who, by the grace of Mackintosh and neat brandy, had
set the elements at defiance. "Let us return to our conveyance,"
said the lively little matron, "and make our way back to the
station of the Great Western Railway; my parasol is wet through
already." "Here is the spot where we left it," ejaculated her
spruce and dapper lord and master, "and no trace of it can I
discover: what is to be done now? And the rascal was paid beforehand
for stopping." "You could hardly have expected he
<em>would</em> stay, however," remarked the stout personage in the nankeen
leggings, the wig, and the very red face, proving thereby that
he was not only a wit but a philosopher; "you could hardly, in
reason, expect the vehicle to stop so long. You should remember
it was a <em>Go</em>-cart."</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REGISTER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>January 15.</span>—A tradesman at the West End was thrown into convulsions,
by the surprise of receiving payment of a Christmas bill!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>February 9.</span>—An elderly "Signer of Fives," who has, for thirty years
past, walked from Walworth to the Bank, without picking up one new idea
by the way, hearing that a deputation of paper-makers had applied to Mr.
Murphy for a little more rain to make their wheels go round, exclaimed,
"Don't tell me, they never can need it; have I not wanted my umbrella
every morning for above a week?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>March 15.</span>—The City Forensic Club applied to the Court of Aldermen for
a contribution; the grant was opposed by one of the Court, on the ground
that they could have nothing to spare for any Foreign-sick Society while
there was so much illness at home.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same gentleman thought it his duty to inform the Court, that there
was a report on 'Change of an alarming rise in Sperma-City. He said he
had been taken from school so long ago, that he had forgotten its locality,
and requested the Remembrancer to remind him. That learned gentleman,
after referring to a map, said he could not exactly find the place, but he
believed it was somewhere in Wales.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>April 1.</span>—At the annual meeting of the Humane Society, medals were
offered for the quickest method of putting disappointed authors out of their
misery—for the means of supplying aldermen, at city feasts, with hot
dinners, and—for the best plan for relieving the baronets from the agonies
they are suffering, on account of their neglected claims.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>May 15.</span>—<em>Legacy extraordinary.</em>—A poor old woman, living at Clapham,
a few weeks ago, was given over by the doctor. Her only anxiety was for
her grandson, a scapegrace lad whom she had brought up, and of whom she
was the only relative. He had been placed under the care of a neighbouring
waggoner, and the man was sent for. "Thomas," said the old woman,
"I feel that I'm not long here, and I fear for Dick when I'm gone. He's a
wild lad, and I've nothing to leave him, but I hope you'll look after him,"—the
man nodded assent,—"and try to make a good lad of him,"—nod—"and
do your duty by him,"—nod again,—"and now and then <em>do give him a cut or
two</em>!" The authorities at Somerset House have not yet been troubled to fix
the duty payable on this bequest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>June 15.</span>—The following advertisement having appeared in the daily
papers, "<span class='sc'>Found</span>—The wig and gown of a barrister <em>unknown</em>," the place
of reference was next day blocked up with applicants answering the description.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>July 21.</span>—Lord Durham, in the midst of the cares of his government, has
not been unmindful of the promotion of science. Among other of his
original projects was one for exporting Canada geese, and domesticating them
in the Bermudas. It was discovered, however, that the attempt was not
likely to succeed, since his Lordship, though he might send them, could not
make them stay there.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>August 9.</span>—The recent default in Clerkenwell parish has been the cause
of the following notice on the Church doors:—"The inhabitants are requested
to remember when their taxes were collected, or they will be recollected."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>October 1.</span>—The Greenwich Pensioners who have lost their legs, this day
presented a petition to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests praying to
be re-membered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span><span class='sc'>November 15.</span>—The Linendrapers' Shopmen held a public meeting to
agitate for earlier hours. Some of the masters, who attended, manifested a
very unaccommodating spirit, and seemed inclined to subject their complaint
to that dangerous system of treatment, <em>counter-irritation</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>December 7.</span>—Lord Durham safely arrived at his house in Cleveland Row
this day. We can vouch for the accuracy of the following particulars. His
Lordship, as he alighted, was observed to look up and down the street, in an
impressive manner, and nodded his head significantly to the porter who
stood to receive him—there seemed to be something in it. His Lordship
passed rapidly through the hall, upstairs, and shortly after his dressing-room
bell was heard to ring. Our reporter, who was stationed at the window of
the opposite house, was not able to ascertain who answered it, but he observed
servants pass out in various directions, and one of them, by his anxious looks,
seemed to manifest peculiar solicitude. Soon afterwards, a butcher's boy
presented himself at the area, with a tray containing three mutton chops;
he received some communication from within, and disappeared rapidly, but
shortly returned, bearing a leg of mutton. No movement of importance
being observed for the next seven minutes, our reporter withdrew to the
nearest public-house for refreshment, and had scarcely taken his seat, when
a servant, in his Lordship's livery, entered, and whispered to the man at the
bar. The words were not heard, but the pot-boy was observed to leave the
house in great haste, having in his tray three pints of half-and-half. It was
rumoured in the private public room, where our reporter was making his
notes, that his Lordship's return was not attributable to political causes
solely, but to the dread of a Canadian winter; for that, though he was amply
furnished with warm feather beds, he had been disappointed in receiving a
supply of <em>bolsters</em> from home.—[<em>Intended for a Morning Paper.</em>]</p>

<p>JANUARY:—The Announcement</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>BARBER COX, AND THE CUTTING OF HIS COMB.<br /> JANUARY.—<span class='sc'>The Announcement.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>On the 1st of January, 1838, I was the master of a lovely shop in the neighbourhood
of Oxford market; of a wife, Mrs. Cox; of a business, both in the
shaving and cutting line, established three-and-thirty years; of a girl and boy
respectively of the ages of eighteen and thirteen; of a three-windowed front,
both to my first and second pair; of a young foreman, my present partner, Mr.
Orlando Crump; and of that celebrated mixture for the human hair, invented
by my late uncle, and called Cox's Bohemian Balsam of Tokay, sold in pots at
two-and-three, and three-and-nine; the balsam, the lodgings, and the old-established
cutting and shaving business, brought me in a pretty genteel income.
I had had my girl, Jemimarann, at Hackney, to school; my dear boy, Tuggeridge,
plaited hair already beautifully; my wife at the counter (behind the tray
of patent soaps, &amp;c.) cut as handsome a figure as possible; and it was my hope
that Orlando and my girl, who were mighty soft upon one another, would, one
day, be joined together in Hyming: and, conjointly with my son Tug, carry
on the business of hairdressers, when their father was either dead or a gentleman;
for a gentleman me and Mrs. C. determined I should be.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jemima was, you see, a lady herself, and of very high connexions: though
her own family had met with crosses, and was rather low. Mr. Tuggeridge,
her father, kept the famous tripe-shop, near the Pigtail and Sparrow, in the
Whitechapel Road, from which place I married her; being myself very fond
of the article, and especially when she served it to me—the dear thing!</p>

<p class='c000'>Jemima's father was not successful in business: and I married her, I am proud
to confess it, without a shilling. I had my hands, my house, and my Bohemian
balsam to support her!—and we had hopes from her uncle, a mighty rich East
India merchant, who, having left this country sixty years ago, had arrived to
be the head of a great house in India, and was worth millions, we were told.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three years after Jemimarann's birth (and two after the death of my lamented
father-in-law), Tuggeridge (head of the great house of Budgurow and Co.),
retired from the management of it; handed over his shares to his son, Mr. John
Tuggeridge, and came to live in England, at Portland Place and Tuggeridgeville,
Surrey, and enjoy himself. Soon after, my wife took her daughter in her
hand and went, as in duty bound, to visit her uncle; but whether it was that
he was proud and surly, or she somewhat sharp in her way (the dear girl fears
nobody, let me have you to know), a desperate quarrel took place between them;
and from that day to the day of his death he never set eyes on her. All that
he would condescend to do was to take a few dozen of lavender water from us
in the course of the year, and to send his servants to be cut and shaved by us.
All the neighbours laughed at this poor ending of our expectations, for Jemmy
had bragged not a little; however, we did not care, for the connexion was
always a good one, and we served Mr. Hock, the valet; Mr. Bar, the coachman;
and Mrs. Breadbasket, the housekeeper, willingly enough. I used to powder
the footman, too, on great days, but never in my life saw old Tuggeridge, except
once; when he said, "O, the barber!" tossed up his nose, and passed on.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day—one famous day last January—all our market was thrown into a
high state of excitement by the appearance of no less than three vehicles at our
establishment. As me, Jemmy, my daughter, Tug, and Orlando, were sitting
in the back parlour over our dinner (it being Christmas time, Mr. Crump had
treated the ladies to a bottle of port, and was longing that there should be a
mistletoe bough; at which proposal my little Jemimarann looked as red as a glass
of negus):—we had just, I say, finished the port, when, all of a sudden, Tug
bellows out, "Law, pa, here's uncle Tuggeridge's housekeeper in a cab!"</p>

<p class='c000'>And Mrs. Breadbasket it was, sure enough—Mrs. Breadbasket in deep
mourning, who made her way, bowing and looking very sad, into the back shop.
My wife, who respected Mrs. B. more than anything else in the world, set her
a chair, offered her a glass of wine, and vowed it was very kind of her to come.
"Law, mem," says Mrs. B., "I'm sure I'd do anything to serve your family, for
the sake of that poor dear Tuck-Tuck-tug-guggeridge, that's gone."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>"That's what?" cries my wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What, gone?" cried Jemimarann, bursting out crying (as little girls will about
anything or nothing); and Orlando looking very rueful, and ready to cry too.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, gaw——" Just as she was at this very "gaw," Tug roars out, "Law
pa! here's Mr. Bar, uncle Tug's coachman!"</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Mr. Bar: when she saw him Mrs. Breadbasket stepped suddenly back
into the parlour with my ladies. "What is it, Mr. Bar?" says I; and, as quick
as thought, I had the towel under his chin, Mr. Bar in the chair, and the whole
of his face in a beautiful foam of lather: Mr. Bar made some resistance. "Don't
think of it, Mr. Cox," says he; "don't trouble yourself, sir;" but I lathered
away and never minded. "And what's this melancholy event, sir," says I,
"that has spread desolation in your family's bosoms? I can feel for your loss,
sir—I can feel for your loss."</p>

<p class='c000'>I said so out of politeness, because I served the family, not because Tuggeridge
was my uncle—no, as such I disown him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bar was just about to speak. "Yes, sir," says he, "my master's gaw——"
When at the "gaw" in walks Mr. Hock, the own man!—the finest gentleman
I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What, <em>you</em> here, Mr. Bar?" says he.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I am, sir; and haven't I a right, sir?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A mighty wet day, sir," says I to Mr. Hock, stepping up and making
my bow. "A sad circumstance too, sir—and is it a turn of the tongs that you
want to-day, sir? Ho, there! Mr. Crump!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Turn, Mr. Crump, if you please, sir," said Mr. Hock, making a bow; "but
from you, sir, never, no never, split me!—and I wonder how some fellows can
have the <em>insolence</em> to allow their <span class='fss'>MASTERS</span> to shave them!" With this Mr. Hock
flung himself down to be curled: Mr. Bar suddenly opened his mouth in order
to reply; but, seeing there was a tiff between the gentlemen, and wanting to
prevent a quarrel, I rammed the "Advertiser" into Mr. Hock's hands, and just
popped my shaving brush into Mr. Bar's mouth—a capital way to stop angry
answers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bar had hardly been in the chair a second, when whirr comes a hackney-coach
to the door, from which springs a gentleman in a black coat with a bag.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What, you here?" says the gentleman. I could not help smiling, for it
seemed that everybody was to begin by saying, "What, <em>you</em> here?" "Your
name is Cox, sir," says he; smiling, too, as the very pattern of mine. "My
name, sir, is Sharpus—Blunt, Hone, and Sharpus, Middle Temple-lane,—and I
am proud to salute you, sir; happy,—that is to say, sorry to say, that Mr.
Tuggeridge, of Portland Place, is dead, and your lady is heiress, in consequence,
to one of the handsomest properties in the kingdom."</p>

<p class='c000'>At this I started, and might have sunk to the ground, but for my hold of Mr.
Bar's nose; Orlando seemed putrified to stone, with his irons fixed to Mr. Hock's
head; our respective patients gave a wince out:—Mrs. C., Jemimarann, and Tug,
rushed from the back shop, and we formed that splendid tableau which the great
Cruikshank has here depicted!</p>

<p class='c000'>"And Mr. John Tuggeridge, sir?" says I.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why—hee, hee, hee!" says Mr. Sharpus; "surely you know that he was
only the—hee, hee, hee!—the natural son!"</p>

<p class='c000'>You now can understand why the servants from Portland Place had been so
eager to come to us: one of the housemaids heard Mr. Sharpus say there was
no will, and that my wife was heir to the property, and not Mr. John Tuggeridge:
this she told in the housekeeper's room; and off, as soon as they heard
it, the whole party set, in order to be the first to bear the news.</p>

<p class='c000'>We kept them, every one, in their old places; for, though my wife would have
sent them about their business, my dear Jemimarann just hinted, "Mamma, you
know <em>they</em> have been used to great houses, and we have not; had we not better
keep them for a little?"—Keep them then, we did, to show us how to be gentlefolks.</p>

<p class='c000'>I handed over the business to Mr. Crump without a single farthing of premium,
though Jemmy would have made me take four hundred pounds for it; but
this I was above: Crump had served me faithfully, and have the shop he should.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A PENNY POST-OBIT.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>My dear Friend</span>,—I write you this letter to explain to you why you have
next to nothing to pay for it. The Government has settled the business; and
the Chancellor of the Exchequer has resolved to set his revenue <em>a going by the
Post</em>. We are to pay a penny for a letter, which is expected to have upon it the
stamp of the Post Office, and of public approbation at the same time. I hardly
think it will. Some of the community are looking dull about it already. There
is a <em>pence</em>-ive air about the two—I beg pardon, the—one penny postmen, which
strikes every one. They intimate that it is gammon to load a man with an additional
hundredweight of paper, and to call <em>that</em> a <em>reduction of public duty</em>. It
clearly affects people of that <em>stamp</em>; and the public surmise it may even touch the
Newspapers. In short, they say that the <cite>Times</cite> will be quite altered by the <em>Post</em>.
Ladies generally seem to like the idea, but there is a visible depression in the
<em>mails</em>. Many a <em>coachman</em> has been thrown off his <em>guard</em>, and surprised into a
most determined alteration of <em>carriage</em>. The Government will be a political mid-wife,
engaged in an everlasting delivery. London is already afflicted with a
metropolitan rheumatism, produced by the introduction of fresh draughts into
passages, the carpenters having cut holes in all the street-doors. Sanguine
people, however, retain their knockers, in the hope of getting the reward offered
for the discovery of <em>perpetual motion</em>! They say there is to be an issue of more
than a million of letters a day; but men are a little at issue about this. There
must be some truth in it, however, as two thousand counters have been engaged,—one
thousand to <em>count</em> them, and the other to <em>count them upon</em>. Sorters of all
sorts are employed. At the Post Offices, at all hours, the <em>pigeon</em> holes will be surrounded
by <em>carriers</em>. The poor fellows will be like muskets, perpetually <em>going off</em>.
Rowland Hill has invented this scheme; but the postmen do not complain of him
so much as of the other <em>hills</em> they must trudge over with their great bags of letters.
The only district there is any contention for is <em>Bag shot</em> heath, once famous for
highwaymen; they say, however, that we are <em>all</em> highwaymen now, and do
nothing but make them "<em>stand and deliver</em>" from morning till night. Some mercantile
quarrels have sprung out of the new regulation. For instance, there is a
good deal of <em>milling</em> among the paper-makers. The march of paper will be prodigious—the
French say we shall have none left, that it will be all <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier marché</span></i>!
Men, women, and children are to write—right or wrong. Enjoinments to this duty—now
the other duty is off—press from all quarters. "Be sure you send me plenty
of <em>notes</em>," says the son, departing for College. "Write to me often, <em>Billy, do</em>," asks
the affectionate mother of her school-going child. Love-letters, containing
mutual <em>pledges</em>, will be <em>popped</em> into the post by thousands; and hearts gone passed
<em>redemption</em> will be slipped recklessly through a hole in the door. It is uncertain
whether orators will not cease <em>spouting</em>, and singers write the notes which they
formerly would have <em>uttered</em>. Ironmongers are looking up—and <em>forgery</em> is going
on famously—in consequence of the great demand for steam <em>steal</em> pens. Manifold-writers
are quite exhausted. I confess, I do not like the system myself—as it's
Hill's, it has its ills; any good in it will appear on an examination—</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>FEBRUARY.—<span class='sc'>First Rout.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We were speedily installed in our fine house: but what's a house without
friends? Jemmy made me <em>cut</em> all my old acquaintances in the market, and I was
a solitary being, when, luckily, an old acquaintance of ours, Captain Tagrag, was
so kind as to promise to introduce us into distinguished society. Tagrag was
the son of a baronet, and had done us the honour of lodging with us for two
years; when we lost sight of him, and of his little account, too, by the way. A
fortnight after, hearing of our good fortune, he was among us again, however;
and Jemmy was not a little glad to see him, knowing him to be a baronet's son,
and very fond of our Jemimarann; indeed, Orlando (who is as brave as a lion)
had, on one occasion, absolutely beaten Mr. Tagrag for being rude to the poor
girl; a clear proof, as Tagrag said afterwards, that he was always fond of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Crump, poor fellow, was not very much pleased by our good fortune,
though he did all he could to try, at first; and I told him to come and take his
dinner regular, as if nothing had happened. But to this Jemima very soon put
a stop, for she came very justly to know her stature, and to look down on Crump,
which she bid her daughter to do; and, after a great scene, in which Orlando
showed himself very rude and angry, he was forbidden the house—for ever!</p>

<p class='c000'>So much for poor Crump. The Captain was now all in all with us. "You
see, sir," our Jemmy would say, "we shall have our town and country mansion,
and a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the funds to leave between our
two children; and, with such prospects, they ought surely to have the first
society of England." To this Tagrag agreed, and promised to bring us acquainted
with the very pink of the fashion; ay, and what's more, did.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, he made my wife get an opera-box, and give suppers on Tuesdays and
Saturdays. As for me, he made me ride in the park; me and Jemimarann, with
two grooms behind us, who used to laugh all the way, and whose very beards I
had shaved. As for little Tug, he was sent straight off to the most fashionable
school in the kingdom, the Rev. Doctor Pigney's, at Richmond.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, the horses, the suppers, the opera-box, the paragraphs in the papers
about Mr. Coxe Coxe (that's the way, double your name, and stick an 'e' to the
end of it, and you are a gentleman at once), had an effect in a wonderfully short
space of time, and we began to get a very pretty society about us. Some of old
Tug's friends swore they would do anything for the family, and brought their
wives and daughters to see dear Mrs. Cox and her charming girl; and when, about
the first week in February, we announced a grand dinner and ball, for the evening
of the twenty-eighth, I assure you there was no want of company; no, nor
of titles neither; and it always does my heart good even to hear one mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let me see, there was, first, my Lord Dunbooze, an Irish peer, and his seven
sons, the Honourable Messieurs Trumper (two only to dinner); there was Count
Mace, the celebrated French nobleman, and his Excellency Baron Von Punter,
from Baden; there was Lady Blanch Bluenose, the eminent literati, author of
"The Distrusted," "The Distorted," "The Disgusted," "The Disreputable
One," and other poems; there was the Dowager Lady Max, and her daughter,
the Honourable Miss Adelaide Blueruin; Sir Charles Codshead, from the City;
and Field-Marshal Sir Gorman O'Gallagher, K.A., K.B., K.C., K.W., K.X., in
the service of the republic of Guatemala: my friend Tagrag, and his fashionable
acquaintance, little Tom Tufthunt, made up the party; and when the doors
were flung open, and Mr. Hock, in black, with a white napkin, three footmen,
coachman, and a lad, whom Mrs. C. had dressed in sugar-loaf buttons, and called
a page, were seen round the dinner-table, all in white gloves, I promise you I
felt a thrill of elation, and thought to myself—Sam Cox, Sam Cox, who ever
would have expected to see you here?</p>

<p class='c000'>After dinner, there was to be, as I said, an evening party; and to this Messieurs
Tagrag and Tufthunt had invited many of the principal nobility that our metropolis
has produced. When I mention, among the company to tea, her Grace
the Duchess of Zero, her son the Marquis of Fitzurse, and the Ladies North
Pole, her daughters; when I say that there were yet <em>others</em>, whose names may
be found in the Blue Book, but shan't, out of modesty, be mentioned here, I
think I've said enough to show that, in our time, No. 96, Portland Place, was
the resort of the best company.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>It was our first dinner, and dressed by our new cook, Munseer Cordongblew.
I bore it very well, eating, for my share, a filly dysol allamater dotell, a cutlet
soubeast, a pully bashymall, and other French dishes: and, for the frisky sweet
wine, with tin tops to the bottles, called Champang, I must say that me and
Mrs. Coxe-Tuggeridge-Coxe drank a very good share of it (but the Claret and
Jonnysberger, being sour, we did not much relish); however, the feed, as I
say, went off very well, Lady Blanch Bluenose sitting next to me, and being so
good as to put me down for six copies of all her poems; the Count and Baron
Von Punter engaging Jemimarann for several waltzes, and the Field-Marshal
plying my dear Jemmy with Champang until, bless her! her dear nose became
as red as her new crimson satin gown, which, with a blue turban and Bird-of-Paradise
feathers, made her look like an Empress, I warrant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, dinner past, Mrs. C. and the ladies went off:—thunder-under-under
came the knocks at the door; squeedle-eedle-eedle, Mr. Wippert's fiddlers began
to strike up; and, about half-past eleven, me and the gents thought it high
time to make our appearance. I felt a <em>little</em> squeamish at the thought of meeting
a couple of hundred great people; but Count Mace, and Sir Gorman
O'Gallagher taking each an arm, we reached, at last, the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young ones in company were dancing, and the Duchess and the great
ladies were all seated, talking to themselves very stately, and working away at
the ices and macaroons. I looked out for my pretty Jemimarann amongst the
dancers, and saw her tearing round the room along with Baron Punter, in what
they call a gallypard; then I peeped into the circle of the Duchesses, where, in
course, I expected to find Mrs. C.; but she wasn't there! She was seated at
the farther end of the room, looking very sulky; and I went up, and took her
arm, and brought her down to the place where the Duchesses were. "O, not
there!" said Jemmy, trying to break away. "Nonsense, my dear," says I, "you
are Missis, and this is your place:"—then, going up to her Ladyship the Duchess,
says I, "Me and my Missis are most proud of the honour of seeing of you."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duchess (a tall red-haired grenadier of a woman) did not speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>I went on. "The young ones are all at it, ma'am, you see: and so we thought
we would come and sit down among the old ones. You and I, ma'am, I think,
are too stiff to dance."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sir?" says her Grace.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ma'am," says I, "don't you know me? my name's Cox—nobody's introduced
me; but, dash it, it's my own house, and I may present myself—so give
us your hand, ma'am."</p>

<p class='c000'>And I shook hers in the kindest way in the world: but, would you believe it?
the old cat screamed as if my hand had been a hot 'tater. "Fitzurse! Fitzurse!"
shouted she; "help! help!" Up scuffled all the other Dowagers—in rushed the
dancers. "Mamma! mamma!" squeaked Lady Julia North Pole. "Lead me to
my mother," howled Lady Aurorer; and both came up and flung themselves into
her arms. "Wawt's the raw?" said Lord Fitzurse, sauntering up quite stately.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Protect me from the insults of this man," says her Grace. "Where's Tufthunt?
he promised that not a soul in this house should speak to me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"My dear Duchess," said Tufthunt, very meek.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't Duchess <em>me</em>, sir. Did you not promise they should not speak; and
hasn't that horrid tipsy wretch offered to embrace me? Didn't his monstrous
wife sicken me with her odious familiarities? Call my people, Tufthunt!
Follow me, my children!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And my carriage; and mine, and mine!" shouted twenty more voices; and
down they all trooped to the hall: Lady Blanch Bluenose, and Lady Max
among the very first; leaving only the Field-Marshal, and one or two men,
who roared with laughter ready to split.</p>

<p class='c000'>"O, Sam," said my wife, sobbing, "why would you take me back to them? they
had sent me away before! I only asked the Duchess whether she didn't like rum-shrub
better than all your Maxarinos and Curasosos: and, would you believe it?
all the company burst out laughing; and the Duchess told me just to keep off,
and not speak till I was spoken to. Imperence! I'd like to tear her eyes out."</p>

<p class='c000'>And so I lo believe my dearest Jemmy would!</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>TOM THE DEVIL.<br /> A FRAGMENT OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF 1839.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I do declare, upon an affidavit,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Romance I've never read like that I've seen:</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would some believe that such a tale had been!"—<em>Byron.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was a little past the noon of a lovely day in the last Autumn, that,
as I rode towards the Doncaster race-course, to enjoy an hour of its rural
revelries, before the serious business of the Leger commenced, I found myself
hailed by a voice, and an arm of a red silk <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">robe de chambre</span></i>, from a drawing-room
window of the "Salutation." Now, when we set out in prepense search
of adventure, it don't require the song of the Syrens to induce us to luff up
to a hail. Turning under the gateway, therefore, I dismounted, and taking
my way upstairs, made the apartment for which I was bound, with but little
difficulty. The chamber was, certainly, not the worst specimen I had ever
seen of the unfortunate world whereof it formed an item. The appointments
combined no ordinary degree of comfort and elegance, while a table, placed
at one of the windows, was stocked after a manner that would have done
honour to the corporation of Bristol. Among various <em>plats</em>, consisting of cold
partridges, French patés, devil'd grouse, and varieties of choice fruit, arose
the graceful forms of tapering flasks, eloquent of many a rare and precious
vintage. The lord or all, arrayed in a robe of scarlet silk, lined with purple
of a like material, lay, dishevelled, in Sybarite indulgence, upon a sofa
adjoining this teeming board. "<em>Couchant</em>," I knew him not; but as he rose
to receive me, there, in that silk attire, stood confessed the worthy, a fragment
of whose biography I am now in the act of perpetuating—the veritable
hero of these presents, even Tom the Devil himself. As my acquaintance
with him at the time (and indeed in all subsequent experience) was of a
very desultory character, this introduction of him to the reader must be of a
similar nature. Ireland was the land of his birth; but the particulars of his
parentage were less definitely ascertained. I was assured he had <em>an uncle</em>
(from an episode in his life that it is not convenient here to enter upon), and,
indeed, he himself admitted that he was in the habit of frequent intercourse
with a person distinguished by that appellation. However, for our present
purpose, it is enough that he was an eccentric, endowed with little of the
tedious coherence of the merely common-place. When we laugh at the
samples of his compatriots, put before us by the playwright and the actor, we
regard them as pleasant burlesques, cleverly, though unnaturally, got up.
Reader! if haply thou hast had no personal experience of Erin as it is, permit
me to offer thee this characteristic fragment.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ould fellow," said the fiend, clutching my hand in a monstrous horny
fist, "by my sowl, I'm grately plazed to meet ye in these parts: when did ye
come to Doncaster? and where do ye hang out? and how long do ye stop?"
"Came by the Edinburgh mail yesterday morning; at my old lodgings at
the saddler's, nearly opposite the Rooms: leave for town to-morrow," said I.
"That's a nate way of doing business, sure enough," was the commentary;
"ounly I can't larn the sinse of going to a private lodging, where, if you
ordher a kidney for breakfast, you're expected to fork out to the butcher. See
how <em>I</em> carry on the war, and never hard the ghost of an inquiry about coin
sense I sot fut in the house. A hotel's the place for me! I've thried 'em all,
from the Club-house at Kilkinny to the Clarendon, and, by the holy poker,
never wish mysilf worse luck than such cantonments! Arrah! what more
does a man require than a place where, if he wants a bottle of claret, all he
has to do is to ring the bell for it? Dine with me to-night," continued
the social economist; "they put you to trough very respectably in this same
shop: ask, and have, that's the ticket." I declined, with thanks; urging a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>previous engagement, and made a demonstration of leave-taking.—"Fill a
bumper of sparkling burgundy before you go, any how," said my hospitable
host; "you'll find it a gentlemanly morning tipple! if this be war, may we
never have pace; here's to our next merry meeting, and may we never know
the want of oceans of wine, plantations of tobacco, cart-loads of pipes, lots of
purty girls, and a large room to swear in.—Farewell."</p>

<p class='c000'>About a fortnight after the date to which the foregoing refers, chance
placed me in Dublin, and the coffee-room of Morisson's hotel, towards eight,
<span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, with the remnant of a bottle of Sneyd and Barton's "twenty-two"
before me. With his back to one of the fires stood what had all the outward
appearance of a scare-crow—a figure made up of a coat that no respectable
old clothesman would degrade his bag withal, and a superlatively "shocking
bad hat." The waiters were eyeing it in a most suspicious manner, and I
was wondering why they didn't kick it into the street, when, to my utter
amazement, the "horrible illusion" stalked towards the place where I sat,
and, in accents familiar to my ear, wheezed out, "Ould fellow, by my sowl
I'm grately plazed to meet ye in these parts!" There could be no mistake
about it—Tom, it was—"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sed quanto mutatus ab illo <em>diabolo</em></span>." "A chair,"
said I, to a waiter who was now staring at us both, like the Trojan who drew
Priam's curtain—"bring a chair and another wine-glass;" and pouring a
bumper, I pushed it towards my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span></i>. "Drink, Tom," I continued;
"whatever maybe your object in this masquerading, a drain of Bordeaux
will never hurt you: drink, and then, unless it's treason, leave off your
damnable faces and begin." "Masquerading!" exclaimed the scurvy libel
upon the Doncaster Sardanapalus, with a smile as much out of character on
such a face as a rose in an undertaker's button-hole; "by the piper of Blessingtown,
it's rale arnest! Unless the smell of mate be disagreeable to you
after dinner, for the honour of dacency tell them to get me a few steakes
without delay: I'm as full of wind as a blown blather: like my ould coat,
I'm dying of the stitches." Several handsome sections of a sirloin having
been disposed of, without the ceremony of oyster sauce, and a wish for materials
for punch (expressed with a look of intense yearning), duly administered
to, "the Devil" thus detailed his progress since our parting:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's mighty nice for philosophers, on three courses and a dessert, to talk
about the uses of adversity being sweet; but if they'll thry a genuine sample
of it, say a can of poorhouse soup (biling dish-wather, flavoured with a farthing
rushlight to the gallon), perhaps they would alther their opinions a <em>leetle</em>.
However, there's no need for these reflections now. How did the Leger serve
you?—I lost (that was of very little consequence)—but I didn't win, and that
<em>was</em>, as I was entirely without funds just thin. Well, I wint to ould——'s,
at night (having transmogrified what odd togs I could muster into cash, by
the assistance of <em>my father's brother</em>), and if it had been '<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vingt un</span></i>,' or '<em>loo</em>,'
we were playing, my fortune would have been made, for I got aces by the
baker's dozen. But at hazard they're not the thing: so I was turned inside
out as clane as a pudden-bag—indeed rather claner, as they got out of me
about four times as much as ever I contained. Whin I rose to lave the house
(who was to stay there with such a run against him?), the blaggards objected
to my taking my Macintosh and hat with me, bad luck to them! and so I
had to return home as classically undressed as William the Third in College
Green. A man without hat or coat, however, isn't so well thought of now-a-days
as among the ancient Romans; and, as misfortunes never come alone,
without half a score to keep them company, I found my credit at the hotel
had gone to look after that which I left at ould——'s hazard-table. No
gentleman should ever demane himself by running the risk of a notice to
quit; so, instead of stopping at the race-ground next morning, I walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>quietly on to Newark. It's raly a purty walk from Doncaster to Liverpool—that
is to say, for those who are fond of pedesthrian exercise—<em>I</em> like
riding better; and so I wasn't sorry whin I seen the Mersey rowling away
on my right. Having left my body-coat in pledge for the last night's lodging,
I had to borry one that was hanging on a stick in a pay-field, and as my
shoes had given in at Norman Cross, I was not just the cut for a fashionable
hotel. A bit of an ague I was lucky enough to pick up at Grantham, however,
qualified me for a berth in the hospital, where I remained till I was
convalescent—which manes on the brink of the grave; so I left, to save them
the trouble of burying me. There's no stepping from the pier-head at Liverpool
to the North Wall here, so that there was nothing left for it but an
application, in form of a distriss'd Irish agriculturist, to the export committee,
and they furnished me with a pass for the hould of a steamer, and a fourpenny
loaf for sea-store. If our passage hadn't been a bad one, I should have done
well enough; but my provision was out before we reached the Orme's Head,
and I was ready to ate my brogues whin I caught sight of you. Never mind!
worse luck now—better another time; as Shakspeare says—'Life's a stage,
and every man plays many parts.' Anthony to-day, Scrub to-morrow."</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>MARCH.—<span class='sc'>A Day with the Surrey Hounds.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Our ball had failed so completely, that Jemmy, who was bent still upon
fashion, caught eagerly at Tagrag's suggestion, and went down to Tuggeridgeville.
If we had a difficulty to find friends in town, here there was none; for
the whole county came about us, ate our dinners and suppers, danced at our
balls—ay, and spoke to us too. We were great people, in fact; I a regular
country gentleman; and, as such, Jemmy insisted that I should be a sportsman,
and join the county hunt. "But," says I, "my love, I can't ride."
"Pooh! Mr. C.," she said, "you're always making difficulties; you thought
you couldn't dance a quadrille; you thought you couldn't dine at seven o'clock;
you thought you couldn't lie in bed after six; and haven't you done every one
of these things? You must and you shall ride!" And when my Jemmy said
"must and shall," I knew very well there was nothing for it: so I sent down
fifty guineas to the hunt, and, out of compliment to me, the very next week I
received notice that the meet of the hounds would take place at Squashtail
Common, just outside of my lodge-gates.</p>

<p class='c000'>I didn't know what a meet was; and me and Mrs. C. agreed that it was most
probable the dogs were to be fed there: however, Tagrag explained this
matter to us, and very kindly promised to sell me a horse, a delightful animal
of his own; which, being desperately pressed for money, he would let me have
for a hundred guineas, he himself having given a hundred and fifty for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, the Thursday came; the hounds met on Squashtail Common; Mrs. C.
turned out in her barouche to see us throw off; and being helped up on my
chestnut horse, Trumpeter, by Tagrag and my head groom, I came presently
round to join them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tag mounted his own horse; and as we walked down the avenue, "I
thought," he said, "you told me you knew how to ride; and that you had
ridden once fifty miles on a stretch!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And so I did," says I: "to Cambridge, and on the box too."</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>On the box?</em>" says he; "but did you ever mount a horse before?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never," says I, "but I find it mighty easy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well," says he, "you're mighty bold for a barber; and I like you, Coxe,
for your spirit;" and so we came out of the gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for describing the hunt, I own, fairly, I can't. I've been at a hunt, but
what a hunt is—why the horses <em>will</em> go among the dogs and ride them down—why
the men cry out "yooooic"—why the dogs go snuffling about in threes and
fours, and the huntsman says, "Good Towler—good Betsy;" and we all of us
after him, say, "Good Towler—good Betsy" in course: then, after hearing a
yelp here, and a howl there, tow, row, yow, yow, yow! bursts out, all of a
sudden, from three or four of them, and the chap in the velvet cap screeches
out (with a number of oaths I shan't repeat here), "Hark, to Ringwood!" and
then, "There he goes!" says some one; and all of a sudden, helter skelter,
skurry hurry, slap bang, hooping, screeching, and hurraing, blue coats and red
coats, bays and greys, horses, dogs, donkeys, butchers, baronets, dustmen, and
blackguard boys, go tearing, all together, over the common after two or three
of the pack that yowl the loudest. Why all this is, I can't say, but it all took
place the second Thursday of last March, in my presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to this I'd kept my seat as well as the best, for we'd only been trotting
gently about the field until the dogs found: and I managed to stick on very
well; but directly the tow-rowing began, off went Trumpeter like a thunderbolt,
and I found myself playing among the dogs like the donkey among the
chickens. "Back, Mr. Coxe," holloas the huntsman; and so I pulled very
hard, and cried out, Wo! but he wouldn't; and on I went galloping for the
dear life. How I kept on is a wonder; but I squeezed my knees in very tight,
and shoved my feet very hard into the stirrups, and kept stiff hold of the scruff
of Trumpeter's neck, and looked betwixt his ears as well as ever I could, and
trusted to luck, for I was in a mortal fright, sure enough, as many a better
man would be in such a case, let alone a poor hairdresser.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the hounds, after my first riding in among them, I tell you, honestly,
I never saw so much as the tip of one of their tails; nothing in this world did
I see except Trumpeter's dun-coloured mane, and that I gripped firm: riding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>by the blessing of luck, safe through the walking, the trotting, the galloping,
and never so much as getting a tumble.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a chap at Croydon, very well known as the "Spicy Dustman,"
who, when he could get no horse to ride to the hounds, turned regularly out on
his donkey; and on this occasion made one of us. He generally managed to
keep up with the dogs, by trotting quietly through the cross roads, and knowing
the country well. Well, having a good guess where the hounds would
find, and the line that sly Reynolds (as they call the fox) would take, the Spicy
Dustman turned his animal down the lane, from Squashtail to Cutshins Common,
across which, sure enough, came the whole hunt. There's a small hedge
and a remarkably fine ditch here; some of the leading chaps took both, in
gallant style; others went round by a gate, and so would I, only I couldn't; for
Trumpeter would have the hedge, and be-hanged to him, and went right for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoop! if ever you <em>did</em> try a leap! Out go your legs, out fling your arms,
off goes your hat; and the next thing you feel, that is, <em>I</em> did, is a most tremendous
thwack across the chest, and my feet jerked out of the stirrups; me left
in the branches of a tree; Trumpeter gone clean from under me, and walloping
and floundering in the ditch underneath. One of the stirrup-leathers had
caught in a stake, and the horse couldn't get away; and neither of us, I
thought, ever <em>would</em> have got away; but, all of sudden, who should come up
the lane but the Spicy Dustman!</p>

<p class='c000'>"Holloa!" says I, "you gent, just let us down from this here tree!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Lor!" says he, "I'm blest if I didn't take you for a robin."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let's down," says I; but he was all this time employed in disengaging
Trumpeter, whom he got out of the ditch, trembling and as quiet as possible.
"Let's down," says I. "Presently," says he; and taking off his coat, he
begins whistling and swishing down Trumpeter's sides and saddle; and,
when he had finished, what do you think the rascal did?—he just quietly
mounted on Trumpeter's back, and shouts out, "Git down yourself, old Bears-grease;
you've only to drop! <em>I'll</em> give your oss a hairing arter them 'ounds;
and you, vy you may ride back my pony to Tuggeridgeweal!" And with this,
I'm blest if he didn't ride away, leaving me holding, as for the dear life, and
expecting every minute the branch would break.</p>

<p class='c000'>It <em>did</em> break too, and down I came into the slush; and when I got out of
it, I can tell you I didn't look much like the Venuses or the Apollor Belvidearis
what I used to dress and titivate up for my shop-window, when I was in the
hairdressing line, or smell quite so elegant as our rose-oil. Faugh! what a
figure I was!</p>

<p class='c000'>I had nothing for it but to mount the dustman's donkey (which was very
quietly cropping grass in the hedge), and to make my way home; and after a
weary, weary journey, I arrived at my own gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>A whole party was assembled there. Tagrag, who had come back; their
Excellencies Mace and Punter, who were on a visit; and a number of horses
walking up and down before the whole of the gentlemen of the hunt, who had
come in after losing their fox! "Here's Squire Coxe!" shouted the grooms.
Out rushed the servants, out poured the gents of the hunt, and on trotted
poor me, digging into the donkey, and everybody dying with laughter at me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as I got up to the door, a horse came galloping up, and passed me; a
man jumped down, and taking off a fantail-hat, came up, very gravely, to help
me down.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Squire," says he, "how came you by that there hanimal? Jist git down,
will you, and give it to its howner."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Rascal!" says I, "didn't you ride off on my horse?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Was there ever sich ingratitude?" says the Spicy. "I found this year oss
in a pond, I saves him from drowning, I brings him back to his master, and he
calls me a rascal!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The grooms, the gents, the ladies in the balcony, my own servants, all set
up a roar at this; and so would I, only I was so deucedly ashamed as not to
be able to laugh just then.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so my first day's hunting ended. Tagrag and the rest declared I
showed great pluck, and want me to try again; but "no," says I, "I <em>have</em> been."</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>I was always fond of billiards: and in former days, at Grogram's, in Greek
Street, where a few jolly lads of my acquaintance used to meet twice a week for
a game, and a snug pipe and beer, I was generally voted the first man of the
club; and could take five from John the marker himself. I had a genius, in
fact, for the game; and now that I was placed in that station of life where I
could cultivate my talents, I gave them full play, and improved amazingly. I
do say that I think myself as good a hand as any chap in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Count, and his Excellency Baron von Punter, were, I can tell you,
astonished by the smartness of my play; the first two or three rubbers Punter
beat me, but when I came to know his game, I used to knock him all to sticks;
or, at least, win six games to his four: and such was the betting upon me: his
Excellency losing large sums to the Count, who knew what play was, and used
to back me. I did not play except for shillings, so my skill was of no great
service to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day I entered the billiard-room when these three gentlemen were high
in words. "The thing shall not be done," I heard Captain Tagrag say. "I
won't stand it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vat, begause you would have de bird all to yourzelf, hey?" said the Baron.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You sall not have a single fezare of him, begar," said the Count. "Ve vill
blow you, M. de Taguerague; parole d'honneur, ve vill."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's all this, gents," says I, stepping in, "about birds and feathers?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh," says Tagrag, "we were talking about—about—pigeon-shooting. The
Count, here, says he will blow a bird all to pieces at twenty yards, and I said I
wouldn't stand it, because it was regular murder."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, yase, it was bidgeon-shooting," cries the Baron: "and I know no better
sport. Have you been bidgeon-shooting, my dear Squire? De fon is gabidal."
"No doubt," says I, "for the shooters, but mighty bad sport for the <em>pigeon</em>;"
and this joke set them all a laughing ready to die. I didn't know then what a
good joke it <em>was</em>, neither; but I gave Master Baron that day a precious good
beating, and walked off with no less than fifteen shillings of his money.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a sporting man, and a man of fashion, I need not say that I took in the
"Flare-up," regularly; ay, and wrote one or two trifles in that celebrated publication
(one of my papers, which Tagrag subscribed for me, Philo-pestitiæamicus,
on the proper sauce for teal and widgeon; and the other, signed Scru-tatos, on
the best means of cultivating the kidney species of that vegetable, made no small
noise at the time, and got me in the paper a compliment from the editor). I was
a constant reader of the Notices to Correspondents, and my early education
having been rayther neglected (for I was taken from my studies and set, as is
the custom in our trade, to practise on a sheep's-head at the tender age of nine
years, before I was allowed to venture on the human countenance), I say, being
thus curtailed and cut off in my classical learning, I must confess I managed to
pick up a pretty smattering of genteel information from that treasury of all sorts
of knowledge, at least sufficient to make me a match in learning for all the
noblemen and gentlemen who came to our house. Well, on looking over the
"Flare-up" notices to correspondents, I read, one day last April, among the
notices, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Automodon.' We do not know the precise age of Mr. Baker, of Covent Garden
Theatre; nor are we aware if that celebrated son of Thespis is a married man.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Ducks and Green-peas' is informed, that when A plays his rook to B's
second Knight's square, and B, moving two squares with his Queen's pawn,
gives check to his adversary's Queen, there is no reason why B's Queen should
not take A's pawn, if B be so inclined.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'F. L. S.' We have repeatedly answered the question about Madame
Vestris: her maiden name was Bartolozzi, and she married the son of Charles
Mathews, the celebrated comedian.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Fair Play.' The best amateur billiard and écarté player in England, is Coxe
Tuggeridge Coxe, Esq., of Portland Place, and Tuggeridgeville: Jonathan, who
knows his play, can only give him two in a game of a hundred: and at the
cards, <em>no</em> man is his superior. Verbum sap.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>"'Scipio Americanus' is a blockhead."</p>

<p class='c000'>I read this out to the Count and Tagrag, and both of them wondered how the
Editor of that tremendous Flare-up should get such information; and both agreed
that the Baron, who still piqued himself absurdly on his play, would be vastly
annoyed by seeing me preferred thus to himself. We read him the paragraph,
and preciously angry he was. "Id is," he cried, "the tables (or 'de <em>dabels</em>,' as
he called them), de horrid dabels; gom viz me to London, and dry a slate-table,
and I vill beat you." We all roared at this; and the end of the dispute was,
that, just to satisfy the fellow, I agreed to play his Excellency at slate-tables,
or any tables he chose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gut," says he, "gut; I lif, you know, at Abednego's, in de Quadrant; his
dabels is goot; ve vill blay dere, if you vill;" and I said, I would: and it was
agreed that, one Saturday night, when Jemmy was at the Opera, we should go
to the Baron's rooms, and give him a chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>We went, and the little Baron had as fine a supper as ever I saw; lots of
champagne (and I didn't mind drinking it), and plenty of laughing and fun.
Afterwards, down we went to billiards. "Is dish Mishter Coxsh, de shelebrated
player?" says Mr. Abednego, who was in the room, with one or two gentlemen
of his own persuasion, and several foreign noblemen, dirty, snuffy, and hairy,
as them foreigners are. "Is dish Mishter Coxsh? blesh ma hart, it is a honer
to see you, I have heard so much of your play."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Come, come," says I, "sir;" for I'm pretty wide awake; "none of your
gammon; you're not going to hook <em>me</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, begar, dis fish you not catch," says Count Mace.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dat is gut! haw! haw!" snorted the Baron: "hook him! lieber himmel,
you might dry and hook me as well. Haw! haw!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, we went to play. "Fife to four on Coxe," screams out the Count.—"Done
and done," says another nobleman. "Ponays," says the Count.—"Done,"
says the nobleman. "I vill take your six crowns to four," says the
Baron.—"Done," says I; and, in the twinkling of an eye, I beat him;—once
making thirteen off the balls without stopping.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had some more wine after this; and if you could have seen the long faces
of the other noblemen, as they pulled out their pencils and wrote I O U's for the
Count. "Va toujours, mon cher," says he to me, "you have von for me tree
hundred pounds."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll blay you guineas dis time," says the Baron. "Zeven to four you must
give me, though;" and so I did: and in ten minutes <em>that</em> game was won, and the
Baron handed over his pounds. "Two hundred and sixty more, my dear, dear
Coxe," says the Count; "you are mon ange gardien!" "Wot a flat Mishter
Coxsh ish, not to back his luck," I heard Abednego whisper to one of the foreign
noblemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll take your seven to four, in tens," said I to the Baron. "Give me three,"
says he, "and done." I gave him three, and lost the game by one. "Dobbel,
or quits," says he. "Go it," says I, up to my mettle; "Sam Coxe never says
no;"—and to it we went. I went in, and scored eighteen to his five. "Holy
Moshesh!" says Abednego, "dat little Coxsh is a vonder! who'll take odds?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll give twenty to one," says I, "in guineas."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ponays, yase, done," screams out the Count.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Bonies</em>, done," roars out the Baron: and before I could speak, went in, and,
would you believe it?—in two minutes he somehow made the game!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>Oh, what a figure I cut when my dear Jemmy heard of this afterwards!—In
vain I swore it was guineas: the Count and the Baron swore to ponies; and
when I refused, they both said their honour was concerned, and they must have
my life, or their money. So when the Count showed me actually that, in spite
of this bet (which had been too good to resist) won from me, he had been a very
heavy loser by the night; and brought me the word of honour of Abednego, his
Jewish friend, and the foreign noblemen, that ponies had been betted;—why, I
paid one thousand pounds sterling of good and lawful money;—but I've not
played for money since: no, no; catch me at <em>that</em> again, if you can.</p>

<p>MAY—A new drop scene at the Opera.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>MAY.—<span class='sc'>A New Drop Scene at the Opera.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>No lady is a lady without having a box at the Opera: so my Jemmy, who
knew as much about music,—bless her!—as I do about sanscrit, algebra, or
any other foreign language, took a prime box on the second tier. It was what
they called a double box; it really <em>could</em> hold two, that is, very comfortably;
and we got it a great bargain—for five hundred a year! Here, Tuesdays and
Saturdays we used regularly to take our places, Jemmy and Jemimarann
sitting in front; me, behind: but as my dear wife used to wear a large fantail
gauze hat, with ostrich feathers, birds of paradise, artificial flowers, and tags of
muslin or satin, scattered all over it, I'm blest if she didn't fill the whole of the
front of the box; and it was only by jumping and dodging, three or four times
in the course of the night, that I could manage to get a sight of the actors. By
kneeling down, and looking steady under my darling Jemmy's sleeve, I <em>did</em>
contrive, every now and then, to have a peep of Senior Lablash's boots, in the
Puritanny, and once saw Madame Greasi's crown and head-dress in Annybalony.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a place that Opera is, to be sure! and what enjoyments us aristocracy
used to have! Just as you have swallowed down your three courses (three
curses I used to call them; for so, indeed, they are, causing a deal of heartburns,
headaches, doctor's bills, pills, want of sleep, and such like)—just, I say, as you
get down your three courses, which I defy any man to enjoy properly, unless
he has two hours of drink and quiet afterwards, up comes the carriage, in
bursts my Jemmy, as fine as a duchess, and scented like our shop. "Come,
my dear," says she, "it's Normy to-night (or Annybalony, or the Nosey di
Figaro, or the Gazzylarder, as the case may be); Mr. Coster strikes off punctually
at eight, and you know it's the fashion to be always present at the very
first bar of the aperture;" and so off we budge, to be miserable for five hours,
and to have a headache for the next twelve, and all because it's the fashion!</p>

<p class='c000'>After the aperture, as they call it, comes the opera, which, as I am given to
understand, is the Italian for singing. Why they should sing in Italian, I
can't conceive; or why they should do nothing <em>but</em> sing: bless us, how I used
to long for the wooden magpie in the Gazzylarder, to fly up to the top of the
church-steeple, and see the chaps with the pitchforks to come in and carry off
that wicked Don June. Not that I don't admire Lablash, and Rubini, and his
brother, Tomrubini, him who has that fine bass voice, I mean, and acts the
Corporal in the first piece, and Don June in the second; but three hours is a
<em>little</em> too much, for you can't sleep on those little rickety seats in the boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The opera is bad enough; but what is that to the bally? You <em>should</em> have
seen my Jemmy the first night when she stopped to see it; and when Madamsalls
Fanny and Theresa Hustler came forward, along with a gentleman, to
dance, you should have seen how Jemmy stared, and our girl blushed, when
Madamsall Fanny, coming forward, stood on the tips of only five of her toes,
and raising up the other five, and the foot belonging to them, almost to her
shoulder, twirled round, and round, and round, like a teetotum, for a couple of
minutes or more; and as she settled down, at last, on both feet, in a natural
decent posture, you should have heard how the house roared with applause,
the boxes clapping with all their might, and waving their handkerchiefs; the
pit shouting, "Bravo!" Some people, who, I suppose, were rather angry at
such an exhibition, threw bunches of flowers at her; and what do you think she
did? why, hang me, if she did not come forward, as though nothing had happened,
gather up the things they had thrown at her, smile, press them to her
heart, and began whirling round again, faster than ever!—Talk about coolness,
<em>I</em> never saw such in all <em>my</em> born days.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nasty thing!" says Jemmy, starting up in a fury; "if women <em>will</em> act so,
it serves them right to be treated so."</p>

<p class='c000'>"O, yes! she acts beautifully," says our friend, his Excellency, who, along with
Baron von Punter, and Tagrag, used very seldom to miss coming to our box.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She may act very beautifully, Munseer, but she don't dress so; and I am
very glad they threw that orange-peel and all those things at her, and that
the people waved to her to get off."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Here his Excellency, and the Baron, and Tag, set up a roar of laughter. "My
dear Mrs. Coxe," says Tag, "those are the most famous dancers in the world;
and we throw myrtle, geraniums, and lilies, and roses, at them, in token of our
immense admiration!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, I never!" said my wife; and poor Jemimarann slunk behind the curtain,
and looked as red as it almost. After the one had done, the next begun;
but when, all of a sudden, a somebody came skipping and bounding in, like an
Indian-rubber ball, flinging itself up at least six feet from the stage, and there
shaking about its legs like mad, we were more astonished than ever!</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's Anatole," says one of the gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Anna who?" says my wife, and she might well be mistaken; for this person
had a hat and feathers, a bare neck and arms, great black ringlets, and a
little calico frock, which came down to the knees.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Anatole; you would not think he was sixty-three years old, he's as active
as a man of twenty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>He!</em>" shrieked out my wife; "what, is that there a man? For shame! Munseer.
Jemimarann, dear, get your cloak, and come along; and I'll thank you,
my dear, to call our people and let us go home."</p>

<p class='c000'>You wouldn't think, after this, that my Jemmy, who had shown such a
horror at the bally, as they call it, should ever grow accustomed to it; but she
liked to hear her name shouted out in the crush-room, and so would stop till
the end of everything; and, law bless you! in three weeks from that time she
could look at the ballet as she would at a dancing-dog in the streets, and would
bring her double-barrelled opera-glass up to her eyes as coolly as if she had
been a born duchess. As for me, I did at Rome as Rome does, and precious
fun it used to be, sometimes.</p>

<p class='c000'>My friend the Baron insisted, one night, on my going behind the scenes,
where, being a subscriber, he said I had what they call my <em>ontray</em>. Behind
then I went; and such a place you never saw nor heard of! Fancy lots of
young and old gents, of the fashion, crowding round and staring at the actresses
practising their steps. Fancy yellow, snuffy foreigners, chattering always,
and smelling fearfully of tobacco. Fancy scores of Jews, with hooked noses,
and black muzzles, covered with rings, chains, sham diamonds, and gold waistcoats.
Fancy old men, dressed in old night-gowns, with knock-knees, and dirty
flesh-coloured cotton stockings and dabs of brickdust on their wrinkled old
chops, and tow wigs (such wigs!) for the bald ones, and great tin spears in
their hands, mayhap, or else shepherd's crooks, and fusty garlands of flowers,
made of red and green baize! Fancy troops of girls, giggling, chattering, pushing
to and fro, amidst old black canvas, Gothic halls, thrones, pasteboard Cupids,
dragons, and such like; such dirt, darkness, crowd, confusion, and gabble of all
conceivable languages was never known!</p>

<p class='c000'>If you <em>could</em> but have seen Munseer Anatole! Instead of looking twenty, he
looked a thousand. The old man's wig was off, and a barber was giving it a
touch with the tongs; Munseer was taking snuff himself, and a boy was standing
by, with a pint of beer from the public-house at the corner of Charles-street.</p>

<p class='c000'>I met with a little accident, during the three-quarters of an hour which they
allow for the entertainment of us men of fashion on the stage, before the curtain
draws up for the bally, while the ladies in the boxes are gaping, and the people
in the pit are drumming with their feet and canes in the rudest manner possible,
as though they couldn't wait.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just at the moment before the little bell rings, and the curtain flies up, and we
scuffle off to the sides (for we always stay till the very last moment), I was in
the middle of the stage, making myself very affable to the fair figgerantys
which was spinning and twirling about me, and asking them if they wasn't cold,
and such like politeness, in the most condescending way possible, when a bolt
was suddenly withdrawn, and down I popped, through a trap in the stage, into
the place below. Luckily, I was stopped by a piece of machinery, consisting of a
heap of green blankets, and a young lady coming up as Venus rising from the sea.
If I had not fallen so soft, I don't know what might have been the consequence of
the collusion. I never told Mrs. Coxe, for she can't bear to hear of my paying
the least attention to the fair sex.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>JUNE.—<span class='sc'>Striking a Balance.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Next door to us, in Portland-place, lived the Right Honourable the Earl of
Kilblazes, of Kilmacrasy Castle, county Kildare, and his mother, the Dowager
Countess. Lady Kilblazes had a daughter, Lady Juliana Matilda Mac Turk, of
the exact age of our dear Jemimarann; and a son, The Honourable Arthur
Wellington Anglesea Blucher Bulow Mac Turk, only ten months older than
our boy, Tug.</p>

<p class='c000'>My darling Jemmy is a woman of spirit, and, as became her station, made
every possible attempt to become acquainted with the Dowager Countess of
Kilblazes, which her ladyship (because, forsooth, she was the daughter of the
Minister, and the Prince of Wales's great friend, the Earl of Portansherry)
thought fit to reject. I don't wonder at my Jemmy growing so angry with her,
and determining, in every way, to put her ladyship down. The Kilblazes'
estate is not so large as the Tuggeridge property, by two thousand a-year, at
least; and so my wife, when our neighbours kept only two footmen, was quite
authorized in having three; and she made it a point, as soon as ever the Kilblazes'
carriage-and-pair came round, to have her own carriage-and-four.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, our box was next to theirs at the Opera; only twice as big. Whatever
masters went to Lady Juliana, came to my Jemimarann; and what do you
think Jemmy did? she got her celebrated governess, Madam de Flicflac, away
from the Countess, by offering a double salary. It was quite a treasure, they
said, to have Madame Flicflac; she had been (to support her father, the Count,
when he emigrated) a <em>French</em> dancer at the <em>Italian Opera</em>. French dancing, and
Italian, therefore, we had at once, and in the best style: it is astonishing how
quick and well she used to speak—the French especially.</p>

<p class='c000'>Master Arthur Mac Turk was at the famous school of the Reverend Clement
Coddler, along with a hundred and ten other young fashionables, from the age
of three to fifteen; and to this establishment Jemmy sent our Tug, adding forty
guineas to the hundred and twenty paid every year for the boarders. I think
I found out the dear soul's reason, for, one day, speaking about the school to a
mutual acquaintance of ours and the Kilblazes, she whispered to him, that "she
never would have thought of sending her darling boy at the rate which her
next-door neighbour paid; <em>their</em> lad, she was sure, must be starved: however,
poor people! they did the best they could on their income."</p>

<p class='c000'>Coddler's, in fact, was the tip-top school near London; he had been tutor
to the Duke of Buckminster, who had set him up in the school, and, as I tell
you, all the peerage and respectable commoners came to it. You read in the
bill (the snopsis, I think Coddler called it), after the account of the charges for
board, masters, extras, &amp;c.: "Every young nobleman (or gentleman) is expected
to bring a knife and fork, spoon, and goblet, of silver (to prevent breakage),
which will not be returned; a dressing-gown and slippers; toilet-box,
pomatum, curling-irons, &amp;c. &amp;c. The pupil must, on <span class='fss'>NO ACCOUNT</span>, be allowed
to have more than ten guineas of pocket-money, unless his parents particularly
desire it, or he be above fifteen years of age. <em>Wine</em> will be an
extra charge; as are warm, vapour, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douche</span></i> baths; <em>carriage exercise</em>
will be provided at the rate of fifteen guineas per quarter. It is <em>earnestly
requested</em> that no young nobleman (or gentleman) be allowed to smoke. In
a place devoted to <em>the cultivation of polite literature</em>, such an ignoble enjoyment
were profane</p>

  </div>

<p class='c000'>To this establishment our Tug was sent. "Recollect, my dear," said his
mamma, "that you are a Tuggeridge by birth, and that I expect you to beat
all the boys in the school, especially that Wellington Mac Turk, who though
he is a lord's son, is nothing to you, who are the heir of Tuggeridgeville."</p>

<p class='c000'>Tug was a smart young fellow enough, and could cut and curl as well as any
young chap of his age; he was not a bad hand at a wig either, and could
shave, too, very prettily; but that was in the old time, when we were not
great people: when he came to be a gentleman, he had to learn Latin and
Greek, and had a deal of lost time to make up for on going to school.</p>

<p class='c000'>However we had no fear; for the Reverend Mr. Coddler used to send monthly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>accounts of his pupils' progress, and if Tug was not a wonder of the world, I
don't know who was. It was</p>

<p class='c000'>and so on; he possessed all the virtues, and wrote to us every month for
money. My dear Jemmy and I determined to go and see him, after he had been
at school a quarter; we went, and were shown by Mr. Coddler, one of the
meekest, smilingest little men I ever saw, into the bed-rooms and eating
rooms (the dromitaries and refractories he called them), which were all as comfortable
as comfortable might be. "It is a holiday to-day," said Mr. Coddler;
and a holiday it seemed to be. In the dining-room were half a dozen young
gentlemen playing at cards ("all tip-top nobility," observed Mr. Coddler);—in
the bed-rooms there was only one gent; he was lying on his bed, reading
a novel and smoking cigars. "Extraordinary genius!" whispered Coddler;
"Honourable Tom Fitz-Warter, cousin of Lord Byron's; smokes all day; and
has written the <em>sweetest</em> poems you can imagine. Genius, my dear madam, you
know, genius must have its way." "Well, <em>upon</em> my word," says Jemmy, "if
that's genus, I had rather that Master Tuggeridge Coxe Tuggeridge remained a
dull fellow."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Impossible, my dear madam." said Coddler. "Mr. Tuggeridge Coxe <em>couldn't</em>
be stupid if he <em>tried</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then up comes Lord Claude Lollypop, third son of the Marquis of Allycompane.
We were introduced instantly, "Lord Claude Lollypop, Mr. and Mrs.
Coxe:" the little lord wagged his head, my wife bowed very low, and so did
Mr. Coddler, who, as he saw my lord making for the play-ground, begged him
to show us the way.—"Come along," says my lord; and as he walked before
us, whistling, we had leisure to remark the beautiful holes in his jacket and
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>About twenty young noblemen (and gentlemen) were gathered round a
pastrycook's shop, at the end of the green. "That's the grub-shop," said my
lord, "where we young gentlemen wot has money buys our wittles, and them
young gentlemen wot has none, goes tick."</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he passed a poor red-haired usher, sitting on a bench alone. "That's
Mr. Hicks, the Husher, ma'am," says my lord, "we keep him, for he's very
useful to throw stones at, and he keeps the chaps' coats when there's a fight, or
a game at cricket.—Well, Hicks, how's your mother? what's the row now?"
"I believe, my lord," said the usher, very meekly, "there is a pugilistic
encounter somewhere on the premises—the Honourable Mr. Mac——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"O! <em>come</em> along," said Lord Lollypop, "come along, <em>this</em> way, ma'am! Go it,
ye cripples!" and my lord pulled my dear Jemmy's gown in the kindest and
most familiar way, she trotting on after him, mightily pleased to be so taken
notice of, and I after her. A little boy went running across the green. "Who
is it, Petitoes?" screams my lord. "Turk and the barber," pipes Petitoes,
and runs to the pastrycook's like mad. "Turk and the ba—," laughs out my
lord, looking at us: "<em>hurrah! this</em> way, ma'am;" and, turning round a corner
he opened a door into a court-yard, where a number of boys were collected
and a great noise of shrill voices might be heard. "Go it, Turk!" says one
"Go it, barber!" says another. "<em>Punch hith life out</em>," roars another, whose
voice was just cracked, and his clothes half a yard too short for him!</p>

<p class='c000'>Fancy our horror, when, on the crowd making way, we saw Tug pummelling
away at the Honourable Master Mac Turk! My dear Jemmy, who don't
understand such things, pounced upon the two at once, and, with one hand
tearing away Tug, sent him spinning back into the arms of his seconds, while,
with the other, she clawed hold of Master Mac Turk's red hair, and, as soon as
she got her second hand free, banged it about his face and ears like a good one.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You nasty—wicked—quarrelsome—aristocratic (each word was a bang)—aristocratic,
oh! oh! oh!" Here the words stopped; for, what with the agitation,
maternal solicitude, and a dreadful kick on the shins which, I am ashamed
to say, Master Mac Turk administered, my dear Jemmy could bear it no longer,
and sunk, fainting away, in my arms.</p>

<p>JULY—Down at Beulah.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>JULY.—<span class='sc'>Down at Beulah.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Although there was a regular cut between the next-door people and us, yet
Tug and the Honourable Master Mac Turk kept up their acquaintance over the
back-garden wall, and in the stables, where they were fighting, making friends,
and playing tricks from morning to night, during the holidays. Indeed, it was
from young Mac that we first heard of Madame de Flicflac, of whom my Jemmy
robbed Lady Kilblazes, as I before have related. When our friend, the Baron,
first saw Madame, a very tender greeting passed between them, for they had,
as it appeared, been old friends abroad. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sapristie</span>," said the Baron, in his
lingo, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que fais tu ici, Aménaïde?</span>" "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et toi, mon pauvre Chicot</span>," says she,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'est ce qu'on t'a mis à la retraite? Il parait, que tu n'est plus Général chez
Franco—</span>" "<em>Chut!</em>" says the Baron, putting his finger to his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What are they saying, my dear?" says my wife to Jemimarann, who had
a pretty knowledge of the language by this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't know what '<em>Sapristie</em>' means, mamma; but the Baron asked Madame
what she was doing here? and Madame said, 'And you, Chicot, you are no
more a general at Franco.' Have I not translated rightly, Madame?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oui, mon chou, mon ange; yase, my angel, my cabbage, quite right. Figure
yourself, I have known my dear Chicot dis twenty years."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Chicot is my name of baptism," says the Baron; "Baron Chicot de Punter
is my name." "And, being a general at Franco," says Jemmy, "means, I suppose,
being a French General?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I vas," said he, "General Baron de Punter, n'est il pas, Aménaïde?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"O, yes!" said Madame Flicflac, and laughed; and I and Jemmy laughed
out of politeness: and a pretty laughing matter it was, as you shall hear.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time my Jemmy became one of the Ladies-Patronesses of that
admirable Institution, "The Washerwoman's Orphans' Home;" Lady de Sudley
was the great projector of it; and the manager and chaplain, the excellent and
Reverend Sidney Slopper. His salary, as chaplain, and that of Doctor Leitch,
the physician (both cousins of her Ladyship's), drew away five hundred pounds
from the six subscribed to the Charity: and Lady de Sudley thought a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> at
Beulah Spa, with the aid of some of the foreign Princes who were in town last
year, might bring a little more money into its treasury. A tender appeal was
accordingly drawn up, and published in all the papers:</p>

<p class='c000'>"APPEAL.</p>

<p class='c000'>"BRITISH WASHERWOMAN'S ORPHANS' HOME.</p>

<p class='c020'>"The 'Washerwoman's Orphans' Home' has now been established seven
years; and the good which it has effected is, it may be confidently stated, <em>incalculable</em>.
Ninety-eight orphan children of washerwomen have been lodged
within its walls. One hundred and two British washerwomen have been
relieved when in the last state of decay. <span class='sc'>One hundred and ninety-eight
thousand</span> articles of male and female dress have been washed, mended, buttoned,
ironed, and mangled, in the Establishment. And, by an arrangement with the
governors of the Foundling, it is hoped that <span class='sc'>the Baby-linen of that Hospital</span>
will be confided to the British Washerwoman's Home!</p>

<p class='c020'>"With such prospects before it, is it not sad, is it not lamentable to think, that
the Patronesses of the Society have been compelled to reject the applications of
no less than <span class='sc'>three thousand eight hundred and one British Washerwomen</span>,
from lack of means for their support? Ladies of England! Mothers
of England! to you we appeal. Is there one of you that will not respond to
the cry in behalf of these deserving members of our sex?</p>

<p class='c020'>"It has been determined by the Ladies-Patronesses to give a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> at Beulah
Spa, on Thursday, July 25; which will be graced with the first foreign and
native <span class='fss'>TALENT</span>, by the first foreign and native <span class='fss'>RANK</span>; and where they beg for
the attendance of every <span class='fss'>WASHERWOMAN'S FRIEND</span>."</p>

<p class='c000'>Her Highness the Princess of Schloppenzollernschwigmaringen, the Duke
of Sacks Tubbingen, His Excellency Baron Strumpff, His Excellency Lootf-Allee-Koolee-Bismillah-Mohamed-Rusheed-Allah,
the Persian Ambassador,
Prince Futtee-Jaw, Envoy from the King of Oude, His Excellency Don Alonzo
Di Cachachero-y-Fandango-y-Castañete, the Spanish Ambassador, Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Ravioli, from Milan, the Envoy of the Republic of Topinambo, and a host of
other fashionables, promised to honour the festival: and their names made a
famous show in the bills.</p>

<p class='c000'>I leave you to fancy what a splendid triumph for the British Washerwoman's
Home was to come off on that day. A beautiful tent was erected, in which the
Ladies-Patronesses were to meet; it was hung round with specimens of the
skill of the washerwomen's orphans, ninety-six of whom were to be feasted in
the gardens, and waited on by the Ladies-Patronesses.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a fine cold collation, to which the friends of the Ladies-Patronesses
were admitted; after which, my ladies and their beaux went strolling through
the walks; Tagrag and the Count having each an arm of Jemmy; the Baron
giving an arm a-piece to Madame and Jemimarann. Whilst they were walking
whom should they light upon but poor Orlando Crump, my successor in the
perfumery and hair-cutting.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Orlando!" says Jemimarann, blushing as red as a label, and holding out her
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Jemimar!" says he, holding out his, and turning as white as pomatum.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Sir!</em>" says Jemmy, as stately as a Duchess.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What! madame," says poor Crump, "don't you remember your shopboy?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dearest mamma, don't you recollect Orlando?" whimpers Jemimarann.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Miss Tuggeridge Coxe," says Jemmy, "I'm surprised of you. Remember,
sir, that our position is altered, and oblige me by no more familiarity."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Insolent fellow!" says the Baron; "vat is dis canaille?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Canal yourself, Mounseer," says Orlando, now grown quite furious; he broke
away, quite indignant, and was soon lost in the crowd. Jemimarann, as soon
as he was gone, began to look very pale and ill; and her mamma, therefore, took
her to a tent, where she left her along with Madame Flicflac and the Baron;
going off herself with the other gentlemen, in order to join us.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears they had not been seated very long when Madame Flicflac suddenly
sprung up, with an exclamation of joy, and rushed forward to a friend
whom she saw pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Baron was left alone with Jemimarann; and, whether it was the champagne,
or that my dear girl looked more than commonly pretty, I don't know;
but Madame Flicflac had not been gone a minute when the Baron dropped on
his knees, and made her a regular declaration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Orlando Crump had found me out by this time, and was standing by my
side, listening, as melancholy as possible, to the famous Bohemian Minne-singers,
who were singing the celebrated words of the poet Gothy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Ich bui ya hupp lily lee, du bist ya hupp lily lee,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Wir sind doch hupp lily lee, hupp la lily lee.</div>
      <div class='line'>Chorus.—Yodle-odle-odle-odle-odle-odle hupp! yodle-odle-aw-o-o-o.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They were standing with their hands in their waistcoats, as usual, and had
just come to the o-o-o, at the end of the chorus of the forty-seventh stanza,
when Orlando started: "That's a scream!" says he. "Indeed it is," says I;
"and, but for the fashion of the thing, a very ugly scream too:" when I heard
another shrill "O!" as I thought; and Orlando bolted off, crying, "By heavens,
it's <em>her</em> voice!" "Whose voice?" says I. "Come and see the row," says Tag;
and off we went, with a considerable number of people, who saw this strange
move on his part. We came to the tent, and there we found my poor Jemimarann
fainting; her mamma holding a smelling-bottle; the Baron, on the ground,
holding a handkerchief to his bleeding nose; and Orlando squaring at him, and
calling on him to fight if he dared.</p>

<p class='c000'>My Jemmy looked at Crump very fierce. "Take that feller away," says she,
"he has insulted a French nobleman, and deserves transportation, at the least."</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Orlando was carried off. "I've no patience with the little minx," says
Jemmy, giving Jemimarann a pinch. "She might be a Baron's lady; and she
screams out because his Excellency did but squeeze her hand."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, mamma! mamma!" sobs poor Jemimarann, "but he was t-t-tipsy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"T-t-tipsy! and the more shame for you, you hussy, to be offended with a

</div>

<p class='c016'>"I say, Tug," said Mac Turk, one day, soon after our flare-up at Beulah,
"Kilblazes comes of age in October, and then we'll cut you out, as I told you:
the old barberess will die of spite when she hears what we are going to do.
What do you think? we're going to have a tournament!" "What's a tournament?"
says Tug, and so said his mamma, when she heard the news; and when
she knew what a tournament was, I think, really, she <em>was</em> as angry as Mac
Turk said she would be, and gave us no peace for days together. "What!"
says she, "dress up in armour, like play-actors, and run at each other with
spears? the Kilblazes must be mad!" And so I thought, but I didn't think the
Tuggeridges would be mad too, as they were; for, when Jemmy heard that the
Kilblazes festival was to be, as yet, a profound secret, what does she do but
send down to the <em>Morning Post</em> a flaming account of</p>

<h4 class='c021'>"THE PASSAGE OF ARMS AT TUGGERIDGEVILLE!</h4>

<p class='c016'>"The days of chivalry are <em>not</em> past. The fair Castellane of T-gg-r-dgeville,
whose splendid entertainments have so often been alluded to in this paper, has
determined to give one which shall exceed in splendour even the magnificence
of the middle ages. We are not at liberty to say more; but a tournament, at
which His Ex—l—ncy B-r-n de P-nt-r, and Thomas T-gr-g, Esq., eldest son of
Sir Th—s T-gr-g, are to be the knights-defendants against all comers; a <em>Queen
of Beauty</em>, of whose loveliness every frequenter of fashion has felt the power;
a banquet, unexampled in the annals of Gunter; and a ball, in which the recollections
of ancient chivalry will blend sweetly with the soft tones of Weippert
and Collinet, are among the entertainments which the Ladye of T-gg-ridgeville
has prepared for her distinguished guests."</p>

<p class='c000'>And now—O that I had twenty pages, instead of these miserable two, to
describe the wonders of the day!—Twenty-four knights came from Ashley's,
at two guineas a-head. We were in hopes to have had Miss Woolcombe, in the
character of Joan of Arc, but that lady did not appear. We had a tent for the
challengers, at each side of which hung what they called <em>escoachings</em> (like
hatchments, which they put up when people die), and underneath sat their pages,
holding their helmets for the tournament. Tagrag was in brass armour (my
city connexions got him that famous suit); his Excellency in polished steel.
My wife wore a coronet, modelled exactly after that of Queen Catharine, in
<em>Henry V.</em>; a tight gilt jacket, which set off dear Jemmy's figure wonderfully,
and a train of at least forty feet. Dear Jemimarann was in white, her hair braided
with pearls. Madame de Flicflac appeared as Queen Elizabeth; and Lady
Blanche Bluenose as a Turkish princess. An alderman of London, and his
lady; two magistrates of the county, and the very pink of Croydon; several
Polish noblemen; two Italian Counts (besides <em>our</em> Count); one hundred and ten
young officers, from Addiscombe College, in full uniform, commanded by Major-General
Sir Miles Mulligatawney, K.C.B., and his lady; the Misses Pimminy's
Finishing Establishment, and fourteen young ladies, all in white; the Reverend
Doctor Wapshot, and forty-nine young gentlemen, of the first families, under
his charge; were <em>some</em> only of the company. I leave you to fancy that, if my
Jemmy did seek for fashion, she had enough of it on this occasion. They
wanted me to have mounted again, but my hunting day had been sufficient;
besides, I ain't big enough for a real knight: so, as Mrs. Coxe insisted on my
opening the Tournament—and I knew it was in vain to resist—the Baron and
Tagrag had undertaken to arrange so that I might come off with safety, if I
came off at all. They had procured, from the Strand Theatre, a famous stud of
hobby-horses, which they told me had been trained for the use of the great Lord
Bateman. I did not know exactly what they were till they arrived; but as they
had belonged to a Lord, I thought it was all right, and consented; and I found
it the best sort of riding, after all, to appear to be on horseback and walk safely
a-foot at the same time, and it was impossible to come down as long as I kept
on my own legs; besides, I could cuff and pull my steed about as much as I
liked, without fear of his biting or kicking in return. As Lord of the Tournament,
they placed in my hands a lance, ornamented spirally, in blue and gold. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>thought of the pole over my old shop-door, and almost wished myself there again,
as I capered up to the battle in my helmet and breastplate, with all the trumpets
blowing and drums beating at the time. Captain Tagrag was my opponent,
and preciously we poked each other, till prancing about, I put my foot on my
horse's petticoat behind, and down I came, getting a thrust from the Captain, at
the same time, that almost broke my shoulder-bone. "This was sufficient,"
they said, "for the laws of chivalry;" and I was glad to get off so.</p>

<p class='c000'>After that, the gentlemen riders, of whom there were no less than seven, in
complete armour, and the professionals, now ran at the ring; and the Baron
was far, far the most skilful.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How sweetly the dear Baron rides," said my wife, who was always ogling
at him, smirking, smiling, and waving her handkerchief to him. "I say,
Sam," says a professional to one of his friends, as, after their course, they came
cantering up, and ranged under Jemmy's bower, as she called it;—"I say, Sam,
I'm blowed if that chap in harmer musn't have been one of hus." And this
only made Jemmy the more pleased; for the fact is, the Baron had chosen the
best way of winning Jemimarann by courting her mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Baron was declared conqueror at the ring; and Jemmy awarded him
the prize, a wreath of white roses, which she placed on his lance; he receiving
it gracefully, and bowing, until the plumes of his helmet mingled with the
mane of his charger, which backed to the other end of the lists, and then, galloping
back to the place where Jemimarann was seated, he begged her to place
it on his helmet: the poor girl blushed very much, and did so. As all the
people were applauding, Tagrag rushed up, and, laying his hand on the Baron's
shoulder, whispered something in his ear, which made the other very angry, I
suppose, for he shook him off violently. "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chacun pour soi</span></i>," says he, "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
de Taguerague</span></i>;" which means, I am told, "every man for himself."</p>

<p class='c000'>After this came the "Passage of Arms." Tagrag and the Baron run courses
against the other champions; ay, and unhorsed two a-piece; whereupon the
other three refused to turn out; and preciously we laughed at them, to be sure!</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now, it's <em>our</em> turn, Mr. <em>Chicot</em>," says Tagrag, shaking his fist at the Baron:
"look to yourself, you infernal mountebank, for, by Jupiter! I'll do my best;"
and before Jemmy and the rest of us, who were quite bewildered, could say a
word, these two friends were charging away, spears in hand, ready to kill each
other. In vain Jemmy screamed; in vain I threw down my truncheon: they
had broken two poles before I could say "Jack Robinson," and were driving at
each other with the two new ones. The Baron had the worst of the first
course, for he had almost been carried out of his saddle. "Hark you, Chicot!"
screamed out Tagrag, "next time look to your head;" and, next time, sure
enough, each aimed at the head of the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tagrag's spear hit the right place; for it carried off the Baron's helmet,
plume, rose-wreath and all; but his Excellency hit truer still—his lance took
Tagrag on the neck, and sent him to the ground like a stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He's won! he's won!" says Jemmy, waving her handkerchief; Jemimarann
fainted, Lady Blanche screamed, and I felt so sick that I thought I should drop.
All the company were in an uproar; only the Baron looked calm, and bowed
very gracefully, and kissed his hand to Jemmy; when, all of a sudden, a
Jewish-looking man, springing over the barrier, and followed by three more,
rushed towards the Baron. "Keep the gate, Bob!" he holloas out. "Baron,
I arrest you, at the suit of Samuel Levison, for——"</p>

<p class='c000'>But he never said for what; shouting out, "Aha!" and "<em>Sapprrrristie!</em>" and
I don't know what, his Excellency drew his sword, dug his spurs into his
horse, and was over the poor bailiff and off before another word: he had
threatened to run through one of the bailiff's followers, Mr. Stubbs, only that
gentleman made way for him; and when we took up the bailiff, and brought
him round by the aid of a little brandy-and-water, he told us all. "I had
writ againsht him, Mishter Coxsh, but I didn't vant to shpoil shport; and, beshidesh,
I didn't know him until dey knocked off his shteel cap!"</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OUT-RIDERS TO THE QUEEN.</h3>

<p class='c016'>I'll have an excursion, a bit of desertion, September diversion, and where
shall I go? If pleasure you mean, sir, at Windsor's the Queen, sir, I'd have
you go in, sir, and see all the show.—At once, gay of heart, then for Windsor
I start, and at Paddington see me <em>in train</em> to depart; and as steam's all the
go, as you very well know, if we go <em>slow</em> to Windsor, we'll go <em>quick</em> to <em>Slough</em>.—The
engine's a great 'un (at desperate rate on, 'twill speed us nor heed us,
while we laugh and scoff), all happy go merry, like gunpowder, werry, as
soon <em>as it's fired</em> the train <em>will go off</em>!—How rapid our pace is! I swear all
the places, like horses at races, do seem to fly by! Oh! how precious quick
now, and see if you're sick now, there's <em>Ealing</em> to cure you, so physic's my
eye! See old Mr. Zitters, who dotes upon bitters, and, in the West Indies,
put <em>wormwood</em> in shrubs: behold him alight now, to get appetite now (still
bitters for ever!) at famed <em>Wormwood Scrubs</em>.—Here's Hanwell, where
Smilem now weeps in th' Asylum; through <em>moonshine</em> and <em>credit</em> his trade
cut its stick; woe followed his laughter, his wits they went after; a lunatic
victim to <em>Luna</em> and <em>tick</em>!—Well now we're at Slough, and no farther need
go, our <em>raillery's</em> over, the train has cried "<em>wo!</em>"—But the "bus," out and
in, stows away thick and thin; dirt and clean, fat and lean, there for Windsor
they pack; the sorry nags speed, very sorry indeed, with a whip at the flank
and a load at the back.—Now all in a bustle, we rush to the Castle, and here
comes the Queen ever smiling and gay, Hurrah! and God save her! she
could not look braver; but those jockies in livery, pray <em>who are they?</em>—Oh!
keep back your sneers, and hold in your jeers, they're her Majesty's
ministers, princes, and peers. With their dingy blue jackets, and collars of
red, their old Windsor uniforms, looking so dead; they might well pass for
"<em>Uniform Postmen</em>" instead!—Now farewell and adieu to the Queen's retinue:
for onward we strode, in the Royal abode, where fine ancient paintings,
paraded to view, are shown by an ignorant thick-headed dunce, whose
brogue murders Masters and English at once.—"Look, here is, an' plase ye,
<em>Paul-very-unaisy</em>, and bad luck if there an't a rale <em>Remembrant</em>:"
so if <em>Dan</em> did but follow the old fellow's tail,
he'd be quite pleased to hear him call Raphael "<em>Rapale!</em>"—But
it's going to rain, and although, to a man, we would
have the Queen's reign be as long as it can; yet as soaking's
"no go," we must rush back to Slough, where panting
and gasping for breath we are dinn'd, sir—with
"What is the matter? you're quite out of <em>Wind-sir</em>."</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>SEPTEMBER.—<span class='sc'>Over-boarded and Under-lodged.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We had no great reason to brag of our tournyment at Tuggeridgeville: but,
after all, it was better than the turn-out at Kilblazes, where poor Lord Heydownderry
went about in a black velvet dressing-gown, and the Emperor Napoleon
Bonypart appeared in a suit of armour, and silk stockings, like Mr. Pell's
friend, in "Pickwick;" we, having employed the gentlemen from Ashley's
Anti-theatre, had some decent sport for our money.</p>

<p class='c000'>We never heard a word from the Baron, who had so distinguished himself by
his horsemanship, and had knocked down (and very justly) Mr. Nabb, the bailiff,
and Mr. Stubbs, his man, who came to lay hands upon him. My sweet Jemmy
seemed to be very low in spirits after his departure, and a sad thing it is to see
her in low spirits: on days of illness she no more minds giving Jemimarann a
box on the ear, or sending a plate of muffins across a table at poor me, than she
does taking her tea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jemmy, I say, was very low in spirits; but, one day (I remember it was the
day after Captain Higgins called, and said he had seen the Baron at Boulogne),
she vowed that nothing but change of air would do her good, and declared that
she should die unless she went to the sea-side in France. I knew what this
meant, and that I might as well attempt to resist her, as to resist Her Gracious
Majesty in Parliament assembled; so I told the people to pack up the things,
and took four places on board the "Grand Turk" steamer for Boulogne.</p>

<p class='c000'>The travelling carriage, which, with Jemmy's thirty-seven boxes and my
carpet-bag, was pretty well loaded, was sent on board the night before; and
we, after breakfasting in Portland Place (little did I think it was the—but, poh!
never mind), went down to the Custom House in the other carriage, followed
by a hackney-coach and a cab, with the servants and fourteen band-boxes and
trunks more, which were to be wanted by my dear girl in the journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road down Cheapside and Thames Street need not be described; we saw
the Monument, a memento of the wicked popish massacre of Saint Bartholomew;—why
erected here I can't think, as Saint Bartholomew's is in Smithfield,—we
had a glimpse of Billingsgate, and of the Mansion House, where we saw
the two-and-twenty shilling coal-smoke coming out of the chimneys, and were
landed at the Custom House in safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fourteen porters came out, and each took a package with the greatest civility;
calling Jemmy her ladyship, and me your honour; ay, and your honouring and
my ladyshipping even my man and the maid in the cab.</p>

<p class='c000'>I somehow felt all over quite melancholy at going away: "Here, my fine
fellow," says I to the coachman, who was standing very respectful, holding his
hat in one hand and Jemmy's jewel-case in the other, "here, my fine chap," says
I, "here's six shillings for you;" for I did not care for the money.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Six what?" says he.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Six shillings, fellow!" shrieks Jemmy; "and twice as much as your fare."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Feller, marm!" says this insolent coachman; "feller yourself, marm: do you
think I'm a-going to kill my horses, and break my precious back, and bust my
carriage, and carry you, and your kids, and your traps, for six hog?" And with
this the monster dropped his hat, with my money in it, and doubling his fist, put
it so very near my nose that I really thought he would have made it bleed. "My
fare's heighteen shillings," says he, "haint it?—hask hany of these gentlemen."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, it ain't more than seventeen and six," says one of the fourteen porters;
"but, if the gen'l'man <em>is</em> a gen'l'man, he can't give no less than a suffering
any how."</p>

<p class='c000'>I wanted to resist, and Jemmy screamed like a Turk: but, "Holloa!" says
one; "What's the row?" says another; "Come, dub up!" roars a third: and I
don't mind telling you, in confidence, that I was so frightened that I took out
the sovereign and gave it. My man and Jemmy's maid had disappeared by this
time; they always do when there's a robbery or a row going on.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was going after them. "Stop, Mr. Ferguson," pipes a young gentleman of
about thirteen, with a red livery waistcoat that reached to his ankles, and every
variety of button, pin, string, to keep it together: "Stop, Mr. Heff," says he,
taking a small pipe out of his mouth, "and don't forgit the cabman."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>"What's your fare, my lad?" says I.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, let's see—yes—ho!—my fare's seven-and-thirty and eightpence
eggs—ackly."</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourteen gentlemen, holding the luggage, here burst out and laughed very
rudely indeed; and the only person who seemed disappointed was, I thought,
the hackney-coachman. "Why, <em>you</em> rascal!" says Jemmy, laying hold of the
boy, "do you want more than the coachman?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't rascal <em>me</em>, marm!" shrieks the little chap in return. "What's the
coach to me? Vy, you may go in an omlibus for sixpence if you like; vy
don't you go and buss it, marm? Vy did you call my cab, marm? Vy am I to
come forty mile, from Scarlot Street, Po'tl'nd Place, and not git my fare, marm?"</p>

<p class='c000'>This speech, which takes some time to write down, was made in about the
fifth part of a second; and, at the end of it, the young gentleman hurled down
his pipe, and, advancing towards Jemmy, doubled his fist, and seemed to challenge
her to fight. My dearest girl now turned from red to be as pale as white
Windsor, and fell into my arms; what was I to do? I called, "Policeman!" but
a policeman wont interfere in Thames Street; robbery is licensed there: what
was I to do? Oh! my heart beats when I think of what my Tug did!</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as this young cab chap put himself into a fighting attitude, Master
Tuggeridge Coxe—who had been standing by, laughing very rudely, I thought—Master
Tuggeridge Coxe, I say, flung his jacket suddenly into his mamma's
face (the brass buttons made her start, and recovered her a little), and, before
we could say a word, was in the ring in which we stood (formed by the porters,
nine orangemen and women, I don't know how many newspaper boys, hotel
cads, and old clothesmen), and, whirling about two little white fists in the face
of the gentleman in the red waistcoat, who brought a great pair of black ones
up to bear on the enemy, was engaged in an instant.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, law bless you! Tug hadn't been at Richmond School for nothing; and
<em>milled</em> away—one, two, right and left—like a little hero as he is, with all his
dear mother's spirit in him: first came a crack which sent his white hat spinning
over the gentleman's cab, and scattered among the crowd a vast number of things
which the cabman kept in it,—such as a ball of string, a piece of candle, a
comb, a whip-lash, a little warbler, a slice of bacon, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cabman seemed sadly ashamed of this display, but Tug gave him no
time: another blow was planted on his cheek-bone; and a third, which hit him
straight on the nose, sent this rude cabman straight down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Brayvo, my lord!" shouted all the people around.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I won't have no more, thank yer," said the little cabman, gathering himself
up; "give us over my fare, vil yer, and let me git away?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's your fare <em>now</em>, you cowardly little thief?" says Tug.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Vy, then, two-and-eightpence," says he, "go along,—you <em>know</em> it is:" and
two-and-eightpence he had; and everybody applauded Tug, and hissed the
cab-boy, and asked Tug for something to drink.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now thought our troubles would soon be over; mine were very nearly so
in one sense at least; for after Mrs. Coxe, and Jemimarann, and Tug, and the
maid, and valet, and valuables had been handed across, it came to my turn. I
had often heard of people being taken up by a <em>plank</em>, but seldom of their being
set down by one. Just as I was going over, the vessel rode off a little, the
board slipped, and down I soused into the water. You might have heard Mrs.
Coxe's shriek as far as Gravesend; it rung in my ears as I went down, all
grieved at the thought of leaving her a disconsolate widder. Well, up I came
again, and caught the brim of my beaver hat—though I have heard that
drowning men catch at straws:—I floated, and hoped to escape by hook or
by crook; and, luckily, just then I felt myself suddenly jerked by the waist-band
of my whites, and found myself hauled up in air at the end of a boat-hook,
to the sound of "yeho! yeho! yehoi! yehoi!" and so I was dragged aboard.
I was put to bed, and had swallowed so much water that it took a very considerable
quantity of brandy to bring it to a proper mixture in my inside; in
fact, for some hours I was in a very deplorable state.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>OCTOBER.—<span class='sc'>Notice to Quit.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Well, we arrived at Boulogne; and Jemmy, after making inquiries, right and
left, about the Baron, found that no such person was known there; and being
bent, I suppose, at all events, on marrying her daughter to a lord, she determined
to set off for Paris, where, as he had often said, he possessed a magnificent——,
hotel he called it; and I remember Jemmy being mightily indignant at the idea;
but hotel, we found afterwards, means only a house in French, and this reconciled
her. Need I describe the road from Boulogne to Paris? or, need I describe that
Capitol itself? Suffice it to say that we made our appearance there, at Murisse's
Hotel, as became the family of Coxe Tuggeridge; and saw everything worth
seeing in the metropolis in a week. It nearly killed me, to be sure; but, when
you're on a pleasure party in a foreign country you must not mind a little inconvenience
of this sort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well: there is, near the city of Paris, a splendid road and row of trees, which,
I don't know why, is called the Shandeleezy, or Elysian Fields, in French: others,
I have heard, call it the Shandeleery; but mine I know to be the correct pronunciation.
In the middle of this Shandeleezy is an open space of ground, and a
tent, where, during the summer, Mr. Franconi, the French Ashley, performs with
his horses and things. As everybody went there, and we were told it was quite
the thing, Jemmy agreed that we should go too; and go we did. It's just like
Ashley's: there's a man just like Mr. Piddicombe, who goes round the ring in a
huzzah-dress, cracking a whip; there are a dozen Miss Woolfords, who appear
like Polish Princesses, Dihannas, Sultannas, Cachuchas, and heaven knows what!
There's the fat man, who comes in with the twenty-three dresses on, and turns
out to be the living skeleton! There's the clowns, the sawdust, the white horse
that dances a hornpipe, the candles stuck in hoops, just as in our own dear country.</p>

<p class='c000'>My dear wife, in her very finest clothes, with all the world looking at her, was
really enjoying this spectacle (which doesn't require any knowledge of the language,
seeing that the dumb animals don't talk it), when there came in, presently,
"the great Polish act of the Sarmatian horse-tamer," on eight steeds, which we
were all of us longing to see. The horse-tamer, to music twenty miles an hour,
rushed in on four of his horses, leading the other four, and skurried round the
ring. You couldn't see him for the sawdust, but everybody was delighted, and applauded
like mad. Presently you saw there were only three horses in front; he had
slipped one more between his legs, another followed, and it was clear that the consequences
would be fatal, if he admitted any more. The people applauded more
than ever; and when, at last, seven and eight were made to go in, not wholly, but
sliding dexterously in and out, with the others, so that you did not know which
was which, the house, I thought, would come down with applause; and the Sarmatian
horse-tamer bowed his great feathers to the ground. At last the music
grew slower, and he cantered leisurely round the ring; bending, smirking, see-sawing,
waving his whip, and laying his hand on his heart, just as we have seen
the Ashley's people do.</p>

<p class='c000'>But fancy our astonishment, when, suddenly, this Sarmatian horse-tamer,
coming round with his four pair at a canter, and being opposite our box, gave
a start, and a—hupp! which made all of his horses stop stock-still at an instant!</p>

<p class='c000'>"Albert!" screamed my dear Jemmy: "Albert! Bahbahbah—baron!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sarmatian looked at her for a minute; and turning head over heels three
times, bolted suddenly off his horses, and away out of our sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was <span class='sc'>His Excellency the Baron de Punter</span>!</p>

<p class='c000'>Jemmy went off in a fit, as usual, and we never saw the Baron again; but we
heard afterwards that Punter was an apprentice of Franconi's, and had run away
to England, thinking to better himself, and had joined Mr. Richardson's army;
but Mr. Richardson, and then London, did not agree with him; and we saw the
last of him as he sprung over the barriers at the Tuggeridgeville tournament.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, Jemimarann," says Jemmy, in a fury, "you shall marry Tagrag; and
if I can't have a baroness for a daughter, at least you shall be a baronet's lady!"
Poor Jemimarann only sighed; she knew it was of no use to remonstrate.</p>

<p>THE HEIGHT OF SPECULATION—Groundless Expectations.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Paris grew dull to us after this; and we were more eager than ever to go back
to London; for what should we hear, but that that monster, Tuggeridge, of the
city—old Tug's black son, forsooth!—was going to contest Jemmy's claim to the
property, and had filed I don't know how many bills against us in Chancery!
Hearing this, we set off immediately, and we arrived at Boulogne, and set off in
that very same Grand Turk which had brought us to France.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you look in the bills, you will see that the steamers leave London on Saturday
morning, and Boulogne on Saturday night; so that there is often not an hour
between the time of arrival and departure. Bless us! bless us! I pity the poor
Captain that, for twenty-four hours at a time, is on a paddle-box, roaring out,
"Ease her! Stop her!" and the poor servants, who are laying out breakfast,
lunch, dinner, tea, supper;—breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, supper again;—for
layers upon layers of travellers, as it were; and, most of all, I pity that unhappy
steward, with those unfortunate tin basins that he must always keep an eye over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Little did we know what a storm was brooding in our absence, and little were
we prepared for the awful, awful fate that hung over our Tuggeridgeville property.</p>

<p class='c000'>Biggs, of the great house of Higgs, Biggs, and Blatherwick, was our man of
business: when I arrived in London I heard that he had just set off to Paris after
me. So we started down to Tuggeridgeville instead of going to Portland Place.
As we came through the lodge-gates we found a crowd assembled within them;
and there was that horrid Tuggeridge on horseback, with a shabby-looking man,
called Mr. Scapgoat, and his man of business, and many more. "Mr. Scapgoat,"
says Tuggeridge, grinning, and handing him over a sealed paper, "here's the
lease; I leave you in possession, and wish you good morning."</p>

<p class='c000'>"In possession of what?" says the rightful lady of Tuggeridgeville, leaning
out of the carriage-window. She hated black Tuggeridge, as she called him, like
poison: the very first week of our coming to Portland Place, when he called to
ask restitution of some plate which he said was his private property, she called him
a base-born blackamoor, and told him to quit the house. Since then there had
been law-squabbles between us without end, and all sorts of writings, meetings,
and arbitrations.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Possession of my estate of Tuggeridgeville, madam," roars he, "left me by my
father's will, which you have had notice of these three weeks, and know as well as
I do."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Old Tug left no will," shrieked Jemmy; "he didn't die to leave his estates
to blackamoors—to negroes—to base-born mulatto story-tellers; if he did, may
I be——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh hush! dearest mamma," says Jemimarann. "Go it again, mother!" says
Tug, who is always sniggering.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is this business, Mr. Tuggeridge?" cried Tagrag (who was the only one
of our party that had his senses); "what is this will?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, it's merely a matter of form," said the lawyer, riding up. "For Heaven's
sake, madam, be peaceable; let my friends, Higgs, Biggs, and Blatherwick,
arrange with me. I am surprised that none of their people are here. All that
you have to do is to eject us; and the rest will follow, of course."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who has taken possession of this here property?" roars Jemmy, again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My friend, Mr. Scapgoat," said the lawyer. Mr. Scapgoat grinned.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mr. Scapgoat," said my wife, shaking her fist at him (for she is a woman of
no small spirit), "if you don't leave this ground, I'll have you pushed out with
pitchforks, I will, you and your beggarly blackamoor, yonder." And, suiting the
action to the word, she clapped a stable-fork into the hands of one of the gardeners,
and called another, armed with a rake, to his help, while young Tug set
the dog at their heels, and I hurrahed for joy to see such villainy so properly
treated.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's sufficient, ain't it?" said Mr. Scapgoat, with the calmest air in the
world. "Oh, completely," said the lawyer. "Mr. Tuggeridge, we've ten miles
to dinner. Madam, your very humble servant." And the whole posse of them
rode away.</p>

<p class='c016'>We knew not what this meant, until we received a strange document from
Higgs, in London; which begun, "Middlesex to wit. Samuel Cox, late of Portland
Place, in the city of Westminster, in the said County, was attached to
answer Samuel Scapgoat, of a plea, wherefore, with force and arms he entered
into one messuage, with the appurtenances, which John Tuggeridge, Esq., demised
to the said Samuel Scapgoat, for a term which is not yet expired, and
ejected him." And it went on to say, that "we, with force of arms, viz., with
swords, knives, and staves, had ejected him." Was there ever such a monstrous
falsehood? when we did but stand in defence of our own; and isn't it a sin, that
we should have been turned out of our rightful possessions upon such a rascally
plea?</p>

<p class='c000'>Higgs, Biggs, and Blatherwick had evidently been bribed; for, would you
believe it? they told us to give up possession at once, as a will was found, and we
could not defend the action. My Jemmy refused their proposal with scorn, and
laughed at the notion of the will: she pronounced it to be a forgery, a vile blackamoor
forgery; and believes to this day that the story of its having been made
thirty years ago in Calcutta, and left there with old Tug's papers, and found
there, and brought to England, after a search made by order of Tuggeridge,
junior, is a scandalous falsehood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, the cause was tried. Why need I say anything concerning it? What
shall I say of the Lord Chief Justice but that he ought to be ashamed of the wig
he sits in? What of Mr.——, and Mr.——, who exerted their influence against
justice and the poor? On our side, too, was no less a man than Mr. Serjeant
Binks, who, ashamed I am, for the honour of the British bar, to say it, seemed
to have been bribed too; for he actually threw up his case! Had he behaved
like Mr. Mulligan, his junior—and to whom, in this humble way, I offer my
thanks—all might have been well. I never knew such an effect produced, as
when Mr. Mulligan, appearing for the first time in that court, said, "Standing
here, upon the pidestal of secred Thamis, seeing around me the arnymints of a
profission I rispict; having before me a vinnerable Judge, and an elightened
Jury—the counthry's glory, the netion's cheap defender, the poor man's priceless
palladium—how must I thrimble, my Lard, how must the blush bejew my cheek—(somebody
cried out '<em>O cheeks!</em>' In the court there was a dreadful roar of
laughing; and when order was established, Mr. Mulligan continued)—my Lard,
I heed them not; I come from a counthry accustomed to opprission, and as that
counthry—yes, my Lard, <em>that Ireland</em> (do not laugh, I am proud of it)—is ever,
in spite of her tyrants, green, and lovely, and beautiful; my client's cause, likewise,
will rise shuperior to the malignant imbecility—I repeat, the <span class='fss'>MALIGNANT
IMBECILITY</span> of those who would thrample it down; and in whose teeth, in my
client's name, in my counthry's, aye, and <em>my own</em>, I, with folded arrums, hurl a
scarnful and eternal defiance!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"For Heaven's sake, Mr. Milligan"—"<span class='sc'>Mulligan, me Lard</span>," cried my
defender—"Well, Mulligan, then; be calm, and keep to your brief."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Mulligan did; and, for three hours and a quarter, in a speech crammed
with Latin quotations, and unsurpassed for eloquence, he explained the situation
of me and my family; the romantic manner in which Tuggeridge, the elder,
gained his fortune, and by which it afterwards came to my wife; the state of
Ireland; the original and virtuous poverty of the Coxes—from which he glanced
passionately, for a few minutes (until the Judge stopped him), to the poverty of
his own country; my excellence as a husband, father, landlord; my wife's, as a
wife, mother, landlady. All was in vain—the trial went against us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was soon taken in execution for the damages; five hundred pounds of law
expenses of my own, and as much more of Tuggeridge's. He would not pay a
farthing, he said, to get me out of a much worse place than the Fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>I need not tell you that along with the land went the house in town and the
money in the funds. Tuggeridge, he who had thousands before, had it all.</p>

<p class='c000'>And when I was in prison who do you think would come and see me? None
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of the Barons, nor Counts, nor Foreign Ambassadors, nor Excellencies, who used
to fill our house, and eat and drink at our expense,—not even the ungrateful
Tagrag!</p>

<p class='c000'>I could not help now saying to my dear wife, "See, my love, we have been
gentlefolks for exactly a year, and a pretty life we have had of it. In the first
place, my darling, we gave grand dinners, and everybody laughed at us."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, and recollect how ill they made you," cries my daughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you must make a country gentleman of me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And send pa into dunghills," roared Tug.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you must go to operas, and pick up foreign Barons and Counts."</p>

<p class='c000'>"O, thank heaven! dearest papa, that we are rid of them," cries my little
Jemimarann, looking almost happy, and kissing her old pappy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you must make a fine gentleman of Tug, and send him to a fine school."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And I give you my word," says Tug, "I'm as ignorant a chap as ever lived."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You're an insolent saucebox," says Jemmy; "you've learned that at your fine
school."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've learned something else, too, ma'am; ask the boys if I haven't," grumbles
Tug.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You hawk your daughter about, and just escape marrying her to a swindler."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And drive off poor Orlando," whimpered my girl. "Silence, Miss," says
Jemmy, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You insult the man whose father's property you inherited, and bring me
into this prison, without hope of leaving it; for he never can help us after all your
bad language." I said all this very smartly; for the fact is, my blood was up at
the time, and I determined to rate my dear girl soundly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh! Sammy," said she, sobbing (for the poor thing's spirit was quite broken),
"it's all true; I've been very, very foolish and vain, and I've punished my dear husband
and children by my follies, and I do so, so repent them!" Here, Jemimarann
at once burst out crying, and flung herself into her mamma's arms, and the pair
roared and sobbed for ten minutes together; even Tug looked queer: and as for
me, it's a most extraordinary thing, but I'm blest if seeing them so miserable
didn't make me quite happy. I don't think for the whole twelve months of our
good fortune I had ever felt so gay as in that dismal room in the Fleet where I
was locked up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Orlando Crump came to see us every day; and we, who had never taken
the slightest notice of him, in Portland Place, and treated him so cruelly that day,
at Beulah Spa, were only too glad of his company now. He used to bring books
for my girl, and a bottle of sherry for me; and he used to take home Jemmy's
fronts, and dress them for her; and when locking-up time came, he used to see
the ladies home to their little three-pair bed-room, in Holborn, where they slept
now, Tug and all. "Can the bird forget its nest?" Orlando used to say (he was
a romantic young fellow, that's the truth, and blew the flute, and read Lord
Byron, incessantly, since he was separated from Jemimarann); "Can the bird,
let loose in eastern climes, forget its home? Can the rose cease to remember its
beloved bulbul?—Ah! no. Mr. Cox, you made me what I am, and what I hope
to die—a hairdresser. I never see a curling-irons before I entered your shop, or
knew Naples from brown Windsor. Did you not make over your house, your
furniture, your emporium of perfumery, and nine-and-twenty shaving customers,
to me? Are these trifles? Is Jemimarann a trifle? if she will allow me to call
her so. O, Jemimarann! your pa found me in the workhouse, and made me
what I am. Conduct me to my grave, and I never, never shall be different!" When
he had said this, Orlando was so much affected, that he rushed suddenly on his
hat, and quitted the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Jemimarann began to cry too. "O, pa!" said she, "isn't he, isn't he a
nice young man?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm <em>hanged</em> if he ain't," says Tug. "What do you think of his giving me
eighteenpence yesterday, and a bottle of lavender water for Mimarann?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He might as well offer to give you back the shop, at any rate," says Jemmy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What! to pay Tuggeridge's damages? My dear, I'd sooner die than give
Tuggeridge the chance."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>                         FAT CATTLE SHOW.</h3>

<p class='c016'>December should be a cheerful month, weather or no. It
should be a warm one too, though never so cold. People blow
their fires and use their bellows within, while the wind bellows
without. Lawyers are glad over <em>Coke</em>. Men <em>take measures</em>
to secure the comfort of their bodies, and preserve the coats of
their stomachs. Though the Legislature does not sit, the
middle classes rejoice in the carrying of <em>many of their bills</em>.
Pastrycooks begin to <em>mince matters</em>; and "eyes" are turned
towards "pies." Politicians affect sincerity; and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peel, tout</span></i>
<em>sweet</em>, becomes <em>candid</em>. <em>Gross</em> acts of plum-puddingizing are
effected by means of a <em>grocer</em>; and <em>Plum-tree-street</em> is then
the sweetest locality in St. Giles's. The Irish daily find fresh
<em>raisins</em> for flocking there. With the sale of plums money
gets <em>current</em>; but the sovereign is just now more valued than
ever, and, at the great theatres, <em>Stirling</em> is all the go. The
markets grow lively, and Smithfield puts forth its show. Pigs
have lots of stuffing, and get so heavy that it is quite common
to ask for a <em>pig of lead</em>. About oxen and sheep there is a
decided <em>ignis fat-you-us</em>. Beasts visit beasts, and human fat
cattle—to survey the quadrupedal—walk in, <em>plump</em>. Butchers
display fine <em>traits</em>. <em>Boxing day</em> arrives, and with it the
<em>knocks</em> of tradesmen, but they only make a <em>hit</em> when they are
paid. People are obliged to wait for their own <em>Nox</em> till <em>night</em>.
Merry drinks and games then stir not the fire, but the fire-side.
The <em>younger</em> branches of families are indulged in wine
that is <em>elder</em>, universal <em>supperage</em> supplies the place of universal
suffrage; and the only ballot is for the bean in the
cake. Christmas is as brave a fellow on land as ever Admiral
<em>Winter</em> was at sea, and should be toasted accordingly. He
lights our fires, and leaves few without fuel:—he tows up our
colliers to warm our toes; and, though he is too kind to sink
the barges, he always <em>scuttles the coals</em>! He is no revolutionist,
for, whilst warming the <em>little</em>, he has a respect for the
<em>grate</em>. "He is," says the Frenchman, "our defender, by <em>de</em>
<em>fender</em>; and if he do seem cold, it is only because he is neither
a <em>bore</em> nor a <em>muff</em>."</p>

<p class='c016'>Tuggeridge vowed that I should finish my days there, when he put me in
prison. It appears that we both had reason to be ashamed of ourselves, and
were, thank God! I learned to be sorry for my bad feelings towards him, and
he actually wrote to me, to say,—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sir,—I think you have suffered enough for faults which, I believe, do not lie
with you, so much as your wife; and I have withdrawn my claims which I had
against you while you were in wrongful possession of my father's estates. You
must remember that when, on examination of my father's papers, no will was
found, I yielded up his property, with perfect willingness, to those who I fancied
were his legitimate heirs. For this I received all sorts of insults from your wife
and yourself (who acquiesced in them); and when the discovery of a will in
India proved <em>my</em> just claims you must remember how they were met, and the
vexatious proceedings with which you sought to oppose them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have discharged your lawyer's bill; and, as I believe you are more fitted
for the trade you formerly exercised than for any other, I will give five hundred
pounds for the purchase of a stock and shop when you shall find one to suit you.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I enclose a draft for twenty pounds, to meet your present expenses. You
have, I am told, a son, a boy of some spirit; if he likes to try his fortune abroad,
and go on board an Indiaman, I can get him an appointment; and am, Sir,
your obedient servant,</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>It was Mrs. Breadbasket, the housekeeper, who brought this letter, and looked
mighty contemptuous as she gave it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hope, Breadbasket, that your master will send me my things, at any rate,"
cries Jemmy. "There's seventeen silk and satin dresses, and a whole heap of
trinkets, that can be of no earthly use to him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't Breadbasket me, mem, if you please, mem. My master says that
them things is quite obnoxious to your spere of life. Breadbasket, indeed!" and
so she sailed out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jemmy hadn't a word; she had grown mighty quiet since we had been in
misfortune: but my daughter looked as happy as a queen; and Tug, when he
heard of the ship, gave a jump that nearly knocked down poor Orlando. "Ah,
I suppose you'll forget me now," says he, with a sigh; and seemed the only
unhappy person in company.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, you conceive, Mr. Crump," says my wife, with a great deal of dignity,
"that, connected as we are, a young man born in a work——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Woman!" cried I (for once in my life determined to have my own way),
"hold your foolish tongue. Your absurd pride has been the ruin of us, hitherto;
and, from this day, I'll have no more of it. Hark ye, Orlando, if you will take
Jemimarann, you may have her; and if you'll take five hundred pounds for a
half share of the shop, they're yours; and <em>that's</em> for you, Mrs. Coxe."</p>

<p class='c000'>And here we are, back again. And I write this from the old back shop, where
we are all waiting to see the new year in. Orlando sits yonder, plaiting a wig
for my Lord Chief Justice, as happy as may be; and Jemimarann and her
mother have been as busy as you can imagine all day long, and are just now
giving the finishing touches to the bridal dresses; for the wedding is to take
place the day after to-morrow. I've cut seventeen heads off (as I say) this very
day; and as for Jemmy, I no more mind her than I do the Emperor of China
and all his Tambarins. Last night we had a merry meeting of our friends and
neighbours, to celebrate our re-appearance among them; and very merry we all
were. We begun with quadrilles, but I never could do 'em well; and, after
that, to please Mr. Crump and his intended, we tried a gallopard, which I found
anything but easy: for since I am come back to a life of peace and comfort, it's
astonishing how stout I'm getting; so we turned at once to what Jemmy and me
excels in—a country dance; which is rather surprising, as we was both brought
up to a town life. As for young Tug, he showed off in a sailor's hornpipe;
which Mrs. Coxe says is very proper for him to learn, now he is intended for the
sea. But stop! here comes in the punchbowls; and if we are not happy, who
is? I say I am like the Swish people, for I can't flourish out of my native <em>hair</em>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jan. 9.</span>—Discovery of the real Vegetable Pills:—A patient hoaxed
the vendor, and, instead of taking them, sowed them in his garden.
A fine crop of peas was the result. The man had been selling those
pleasant vegetables, in boxes, disguised as pills by being covered
with an outer coating of flour; but, from having been always <em>in
flower</em>, they were now thoroughly <em>blown</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'>In the north, a Coroner's inquest was held upon the body of a
man who died from taking another kind of Vegetable Pills. On
opening the body the interior was discovered to be one huge cabbage,
of great dimensions, but dead, to its heart's core, of confinement
and want of water—a beverage which the patient unfortunately
never drank. The jury returned a verdict of "<em>quits</em>." "Quits,
gentlemen!" exclaimed the dismayed Coroner—"never heard of
such a thing! What do you mean?" "Why," replied the foreman,
with some warmth, "we find that if the cabbage killed the
man, the man most certainly killed the cabbage; and if that ain't
quits, blow me!"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Jan. 24.</span>—Her Majesty went on to the stage of Drury Lane

twelve generals, upon the plea of the general welfare. Rather a
contradictory reason; but Don Carlos entered
France in consequence. They say his chiefs were
bribed by a <em>palmer's stone</em>, and it is certain there
was some palming, any way. The only commander
that now sticks to him is Cabrera, and he's not

<h3 class='c007'>ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH ILLUMINATI, HELD AT<br /> BIRMINGHAM, IN AUGUST, 1839.</h3>

<p class='c022'>[We have been requested to insert the following selections from the proceedings
of the Institution, in consequence of the unhandsome conduct of
some of the newspapers, in refusing to publish any further reports unless they
were paid for as advertisements.]</p>

<p class='c000'>A great feature, in the meeting this year, has been the elegant
and intelligible simplicity of the subjects and papers discussed; the
following are a few of the most interesting:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bewdlite's paper "On the retrograde Progression of vegetable
Ærolites, supposed to be caused by the flowing Stagnation of diurnal
Currents, coming in Contact with a Board of Guardians," was much
admired; as well as Dr. Terncow's admirable paper "On the Tendency
of extreme Nervous Filaments to form Photogenic Conventions,"
and "The Advantages derived from forcing condensed Air
into the Brain, to sharpen the Powers of Hearing," by which means
a whisper at Dover could be distinctly heard at Boulogne.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the head of Section W, an interesting report was read by
Dr. Buckleband, on some important geological and antiquarian
discoveries, which were made, in the neighbourhood of Holborn, by
the workmen employed in a lying down gas-pipes. It appeared
that, at the depth of six feet below the mud formation, having
passed through a <em>stratum</em> of London dirt, teeming with interesting
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reliquiæ</span></i> of blacking-bottles and tobacco-pipes, in a fine state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>petrifaction, together with traces of decayed vegetable matter, interspersed
with bones of feline <em>mammalia</em>, they struck upon a mass
of regular brickwork, which was, at first, supposed to be the remains
of the Roman road which formerly ran from King's Cross to Evans's
Hotel, in Covent Garden. On carefully removing the masonry, they
arrived at a curiously constructed apartment, or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cella</span></i>, containing
several dozen bottles, of modern form, reclining in sawdust round the
walls. The wine in the bottles was found to be perfectly unimpaired
by its long repose, and tasted fresh and sweet. One gentleman pronounced
it to be the Massican wine so lauded by Pliny. Another,
who had hitherto pretended to be a judge of old wine, stated that it
was merely a compound of inferior port (fine rough flavour, 30<em>s.</em>)
and red currant, with a small admixture of English brandy. The
learned professor merely mentioned this absurd opinion as a matter
of entertainment. One of the most singular features of this gratifying
discovery, was one of the everlasting lamps, of which curious
light a small jet was burning over the bins, with a flame exactly resembling
gas. He expected a further report of their proceedings by
the seven o'clock train. While the learned gentleman was speaking,
the communication arrived. Much excitement prevailed as he read
the paper; and one of the audience, in his nervous agitation, took
another's snuff-box by mistake. It appeared that the workmen had
descended, in company with several contributors to the "Gentleman's
Magazine," and, following a long passage, similarly adorned with
bottles, began to contemplate the idea of bringing to light an entire
subterranean Roman city; probably destroyed by one of the early
volcanic eruptions of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mons Primula</span></i>, or Primrose Hill, of the
ancients. On ascending a flight of steps they came to a small door,
which they eagerly forced open, and the astonished group found
themselves in the "bottling department" of what had been apparently
an early Roman "wine vaults."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Lyme Stone produced a fine fossil specimen of the claw of
some extinct animal, which had been discovered by the excavators
of the Southampton Railroad. He had shown it to the learned professor,
who had drawn the entire animal from this single specimen;
and, on comparing it with the Munkorsensauros, it was found to be
correct, with the exception of the tail being curly instead of straight.
Mr. Planecence inquired if it was not likely to be the claw of an
eagle, in composition similar to those displayed in the New Road,
where the two gentlemen, without any clothes, are represented as
playing at single-stick. He was strengthened in this idea by observing
an iron pin running through the claw, probably to fix it to the
pedestal. Mr. Lyme Stone was sorry that the honourable and
learned gentleman was such a confounded fool. The pin with which
it was transfixed was evidently a weapon of chase, proving the existence
of man upon the earth to be coeval with his desire for food.</p>

<p class='c000'>An angry discussion would doubtless have taken place had not the
hour sounded for dinner. The company speedily separated, and
proved the superiority of the attraction that ducks and salmon possessed
over inorganic incomprehensibles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hold thy breath lightly, while I outpour to thee, in gentle
diction, my prediction of events. Behold the Hieroglyphic
Interpreter of the symbols of the present and the future; and
what a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</span></i> of things—both <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in posse</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in esse</span></i>—it closes and
discloses under its mystic mantle. Imagine thyself, for a moment,
like the topmost sails of some goodly vessel,—the moon-raker—the
star-gazer—the sky-scraper of the Firm-i-meant; and peruse what
my prophecy doth, by a ruse, foretel. See the signs of my designs.
Now, high in the mid-heaven, behold <em>Albertus Sagittarius</em> as the
Cupid Archer, driving his love-dart through the window of that
constellatory hotel, known in great and little Britain by the sign
of the <em>Virgo</em> and <em>Crown</em>. Behold the <em>Miss</em> is <em>hit</em>. This is portentous
of hymen; but other high men, lo! are typified in those
dejected falling stars, pursuing their downward decadence from the
court-yard of the palatial Inn. Now, then, shall marriage spread
wide its pinions among people of all opinions, and the cord of con-cord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>shall be tied. See that gorgeous hecatomb of <em>hearts</em>, which
the young <em>trump, Love</em>, fires and inspires with fame and flame.
He, behold, is the rightful Duke of <em>Victoria; husbanding</em> his
resources, and yet setting the tide of conquest through the world.
Baby linen becomes shortly at a premium, and my art foresees a
prevalence of <em>Sun</em> and <em>Air</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Whirled</em> into fire, see the political <em>world</em>, and <em>ire</em> burst from the
soil of <em>Ire</em>-land. In fancy, I behold the flames, now in <em>in</em>-fancy,
mount and swell. Jack <em>Frost</em> sits melancholy mad, and burns his
fingers by the blaze he essays to raise; but there are other <em>Jacks</em>
that want <em>roasting</em>, which the courteous Reader will <em>smoke</em>. The
<em>broils</em> are not over; and, though the fierceness of the fire of politics
will not evaporate the Thames, yet, from Westminster to the
Tower, it shall send forth a <em>hissing noise</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But sit thou lightly on thy throne, Victoria! for the tumult
shall be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumultum in parvo</span></i>; and thy people, convinced that it was
<em>infra dig.</em> to abandon the <em>spade</em> for the pike, and assume the
habits of the <em>rake</em>, will leave the fields of speculation for those of
agriculture; and their sons and daughters, emulating thy good
example, will betake them to arts of <em>husband</em>ry, cast away their
<em>divisions</em> for <em>multiplication</em>, and thus enjoy the Irish <em>sunshine</em> of a
genial <em>reign</em>.</p>

I'm sartain sure it must be done in jest; for if every hat aint hoff instead
of hon, I'm blest! Hat on, indeed! vell, sartinly it's vindy; and here's a
pretty shindy. They've rose the flat'lent element at last, and here it's peppering
on, a precious blast! It's nuffin but a reglar blast of ruin, undoin'
every von vith vot it's doin. Vell, blacksmiths must be
most unconscionable fellows, if, such a day as this, they
vants a bellows. I can't even svear; my pals u'd
hardly know me: I don't feel no occasion to say "blow
me." Oh! oh! here's a go! The voman's blowing
over; she's a reglar charmer, but so unkimmon fat it
can't much harm her. Vont there be chimbley accidents:—ay!
lots. Look, look at Harmer and Flower's
flower-pots; they're a fallin' on that old gentleman's
head as valks below; and vot's vurse, it's too vindy
for him to return the "blow." [They say as
Alderman Harmer has left the town off, and he's
made a breeze in the city vith the vind as he vhisk'd his gown off.] Vell,
I'm hoff, so here goes; my eyes, how it blows! That ere image-boy can't
hold his tray; ain't his kings and queens, and dukes, a rattlin avay. There
goes a couple slick; the vind's broke Vellington and little Vic. Go it, my
hearty! that's it, you've shivered Bonyparty; and, notwithstanding the
furious vay in vich it blows and rains, if he ain't a stopping to pick up Napoleon's
remains! Vell, I've heard of "mad as a March air," and precious
mad I find it is, still I can't say as I care: as long as I get home safe, and
there's nobody killed, I sees no great harm <em>in</em> it; only I hopes that them as
vere particularly anxious to raise the vind, is vell satisfied this very minit!</p>

"No," answered the awkward gentleman, who had prematurely risen to
depart; but, upon the word, his foot slipped over the hearth-rug, and he fell.
"In refusing that cup of tea, and tumbling so soon after, you remind me of
'Gibbon's Roman Empire,'" said the wag of the tea-party. "Why?"

      <div class='line'>By Falstaff's flabbergastered frown,</div>

      <div class='line'>Where he stood before like a swell so nobby,</div>
      <div class='line'>He's ready to burst with passion and thirst,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he'd get up a row, and bully 'em now,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he sees the new police in the lobby.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So, to hide what he feels, he turns on his heels,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to all his retinue making a sign,</div>

      <div class='line'>Close behind his benevolent face,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And belly and back, as he's taking his whack,</div>
      <div class='line'>Good Master Clown is making grimace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And acting toastmaster-in-chief of the place.</div>
      <div class='line'>Falstaff glows, from his top to his toes,</div>
      <div class='line'>His great big body keeps warming his clothes,</div>
      <div class='line'>As he puffs and blows, while his glass overflows,</div>
      <div class='line'>He is lighting his clay pipe at Bardolph's nose</div>
      <div class='line'>Drury Lane has dismissed him, alack!</div>
      <div class='line'>But Falstaff's accustomed to <em>getting the sack</em>!</div>
      <div class='line'>There he sits like a friar or monk,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the guests around grow uncommonly drunk;</div>
      <div class='line'>The witch of the party, with gin they cram her,</div>
      <div class='line'>In their eager strife for the good of the <em>dram her</em>;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Shakspeare's voice, from bottle and stoup,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Warned all the spirits to go their ways,</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE LICENSED VICTUALLERS' DINNER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The dinner of the Licensed Victuallers is better to them than the
wisdom of Solomon, or the ore of lore: it is their feast of literature,
for they consider it in the light of a splendid annual—magnificently
bound in calf for society—with the <em>cloth</em> edition especially reserved
for themselves. It is a pleasure to behold their spread, the chairman
soaring into Epicurean sublimity, like the <em>spread eagle</em>, or feasting
like the golden vulture upon quid <em>vult</em>. See, they have gathered in
the strength of their conviviality. Every one of them is a landlord,
if not a lord of the land; how they labour at their vocation of cram!
Their festive board has become a board of works; and they are all
busy about the pleasantest half of the trade of <em>carver</em> and gilder.
Every man, like a tailor, is taking his full measure; their whole
vision is given to the pro-vision; and they are now, more than doctors
and lawyers, among the <em>feed</em>. Pollok's "Course of Time" is nothing to
the course of victuals now produced. All the creatures that figure on
their sign-boards have been brought up and dressed for the nonce.
Rarities are here, which it must have required a new edition of
"Cook's Voyages" to procure. The <em>Goose with</em> the <em>Gridiron</em>, the
Magpie <em>without</em> the <em>Stump</em>, the <em>Swan with two Necks</em>, and the throttle
of some youthful Boniface acting <em>Lad-lane</em> for the luxury: a joint
from the Pig in the Pound; the Blue Boar done thoroughly brown;
the meek Lamb sent saucey from the Mint; the Dolphin, by off-slicing
process, changing its size and not its dyes; the "Cock" with
exquisite stuffing, so that it emulates a firm of city silversmiths, and
becomes "Cock Savoury;" the Hen and Chickens, quite a gentle
brood, roasted for food; "the Salmon," accustomed to swim,
now beginning in consequence to sink; and last, not least, the Peacock
assisting at the spread! Sure here is food for reflection, and
the <em>great body</em> of Licensed Victuallers may rejoice in the victuals
thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dinner is now over. The "Queen" is disposed of; the "Royal
Family" are settled; the "Army and Navy" are dispatched.
Although it is not an ordinary, they have gone through the ordinary
toasts: the business of the evening is about to be commenced; the
Chairman is on his mettle, and on his legs. He is a wit and a wittler;
a patriot on the side of the public-houses and the public. Bodily,
as well as oratorically, he is a great speaker, and his eloquence is now
let loose. He informs the company before him of the great importance
of the humane and intoxicating society to which he belongs. He tells
them that the Licensed Victuallers are connected with all that is elevating
(spirits for instance), civilizing, and admirable, in town and
country. They are identified equally with the lush and the literature
of the land; for he is prepared to contend that whatever has
been great in literature is deducible from lush. Every author of
eminence has been more or less inspired from the tap, the bin, the
cellar, or the bar. The Edinburgh Castle has never been a Castle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>of Indolence; and taverns must be regarded as the fountains of the
mind. Vehement cries of "bravo!" and "draw it mild!" here interrupt
the speaker; but he declares he cannot draw it any milder,
and that it would be stale, flat, and unprofitable if he did. He
would prove his case. The poet who quaffs British brandy is filled
with patriotic spirit, and writes nobly for native land. The wit confines
himself to what is rum. The nautical novelist sticks to port.
Gin inspires the great delineators of human life. What, for instance,
but gin-twist could have brought Oliver Twist to light? He would
repeat—that lush and literature were indissolubly connected, and
that the press and the punch-bowl were one. Yes, the very press
was nothing but a great punch-bowl. Its thunder, devilism, and
vituperation, were the spirit; its bland praises were the sweets;
its sarcastic truths and stings were the blended bitter and acid;
its pleasant news was the aroma from the lemon-peel; its quarrels
were the hot water; its sneers were the cold: it sometimes created
a terrible stir; but then punch was nothing without that; and,
finally, the newsmen were the glasses, and when all was done, the
editors were the ladles—he said ladles emphatically, lest they should
be taken for <em>spoons</em>—that doled it out to the eager-swallowing community.
(Loud cries of "capital," and incessant cheering.) All
these things incontestably proved that the kings of the lush were
the kings of the literature of the land; and, therefore, the Licensed
Victuallers were at the head of the civilization of the empire. It
was said that "knowledge is power;" very well—then the public
had to thank them and their brewers. They might talk of their
cheap periodicals, but, he would ask, would there be any circulation
of instruction in this kingdom if it was not for the respectable firm
of <em>Read</em> and Co.? Another gentleman was a <em>Whitbread</em>—he might
say, a wit-bred and born: but there was no end of illustration;
and, if knowledge was power, it was a brewer's dray-horse power;
it passed to the public through the cellars of the publicans, and all
he could say was, if it came up "<em>heavy</em>," it went down light. "He
should, <em>therefore</em>, give—Prosperity to the Licensed Victuallers'
Institution."</p>

<p class='c000'>The toast is drunk with applause—the Chairman shortly after
follows its example, and by two in the morning the company have
got under the table over their wine.</p>

      <div class='line'>Whether it's the west-end nobs, or the city folks—confound 'em! I could cry with vexation;</div>
      <div class='line'>But this I will say, if it's the latter, they ain't fit for their city-wation.</div>
      <div class='line'>What is to become of all us poor showmen, as has embarked every penny we've got,</div>
      <div class='line'>In learned pigs, and crocodiles, and sheep with two heads, and wax Thurtells, and what not?</div>
      <div class='line'>It's werry unfair to make us an exception to the general rule of the nation;</div>
      <div class='line'>You orts to consider our wested rights, as free-born Britons, and allow us "a compensation."</div>
      <div class='line'>When you stopp'd the rich West Indy merchants from dealing in poor African niggers,</div>
      <div class='line'>You allowed them twenty millions of money; and, surely, showing a few hinnocent wax figgers</div>
      <div class='line'>Aint worse than stealing one's black feller creturs, and carrying 'em off, and treating 'em worse than swine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, let me tell you, a lamb with two tails is much more preferabler than a cat with nine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! dear; oh! dear; what is to become of us all, from Mr. Wombwell down to the penny peeps?</div>
      <div class='line'>We're wuss off than the poor silenced muffin-men, or the poor unfortynat forbid-to-go-up-the-chimbly sweeps!</div>
      <div class='line'>It's fine talking, taking to other businesses; and going out as lackeys and servants, ifegs!</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, d'ye think, would take, as lady's maid or nurs'ry governess, poor Miss Biffin, without either arms or legs?</div>
      <div class='line'>And what great duchess or countess would like to have walking behind her, in Regent Street,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a powder'd head and long cane, poor Thomas Short, the Lincolnshire dwarf, as measures only three feet?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or what gentleman in the Park, driving his cab on a Sunday afternoon, would choose</div>
      <div class='line'>For his tiger, stuck up behind in top-boots and white gloves, the Nottingham youth, as stands 7 foot 3 in his shoes?</div>
      <div class='line'>To say nothing of the indignity of the thing: for how is a man to go to submit to come down,</div>
      <div class='line'>From being a Royal Red-Indian Prince, to nothing but a poor common-day-labouring clown?</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Siamese twins, oh! Gemini, they might advertise in the <cite>Times</cite> for a cent'ry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Before any merchant would take them into his counting-house, to keep his books by double entry.</div>
      <div class='line'>And now Mister Bunn's given up Drury Lane to Mister Musard and his French and German crew,</div>

      <div class='line'>By Jove, such news as this is enough to make every inch of it turn grey in a night.</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Indian juggler, poor fellow! neat as imported from the coast of Delhi,—</div>
      <div class='line'>He may swallow swords and daggers long enough before he's able to fill his belly!</div>
      <div class='line'>We've all our ups and downs in this world, it's said—or, at least, used to be;</div>
      <div class='line'>But "Marshall Mayor" wont leave so much as a poor single Up-and-down for we.</div>
      <div class='line'>And one thing I must take the liberty to say, I don't see why the poor people's fairs</div>
      <div class='line'>Should be put down and done away with, while the rich <em>Fancy</em> people are allowed to keep up theirs;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as for the morality, it does seem rather funny to shut up Bartlemy Fair o' Mondays,</div>
      <div class='line'>While they keep open their genteel wild-beast-show in the Regency Park o' Sundays,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our booths are our homes; and we've nowhere to go to when these are taken,</div>
      <div class='line'>They must recollect that the Learned Pig ain't a lord, like the Learned Bacon.</div>
      <div class='line'>The learned pig may carry himself off to Newgate market—it is but just over the way,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the alligator may indulge himself shedding crocodile tears for ever and a day:</div>
      <div class='line'>The elephant may pack up his trunk; for Smithfield he must abandon:</div>
      <div class='line'>And the mare with seven feet may cut her stick, for she hasn't a leg to stand on:</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>A LONDON FOG.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Now, the sun, after a vain attempt to catch a glimpse of St. Paul's, or the
Monument, gives it up in despair; while his morning herald, Lucifer, finds the
fog more than a Lucifer match for him, and goes out like a damp Jones-and-Co.
of a windy night. Now, the sleepy housemaid is in a fine trepidation, on discovering
that her missis <em>was</em> right in giving her seven-o'clock ring an hour
ago; she (the maid) having just counted eight in full, on the kitchen clock.
Now, hook noses and cries of "clo" are more rife than ever; and, somehow or
other, silver spoons and forks disappear more frequently from the "domestic
hearth." Now, the poor behind-hand city clerk, who <em>must</em> be at his desk, in
Lombard-street, by nine (it is now half-past eight by <em>Lambeth Palace clock</em>), determines
to sacrifice fourpence on the Iron-boat Company; and, having passed
an agonizing ten minutes in the cold, sloppy cabin, is at last annihilated by the
steward's informing him that, in consequence of the denseness of the fog, the
captain has determined not to run the boat this morning. Now, invisible cabmen
drive unseen horses along viewless thoroughfares, and omnibusses go,
flitting like so many Flying Dutchmen, through the mist and fog. Now, the
two young gentlemen who have a coffee-and-pistol appointment at Chalk Farm,
find it anything but agreeable to be set up only three yards asunder, instead of
having the length of Primrose Hill between them, so as to have had a reasonable
chance of <em>missing</em> one another. Now, a walk in the neighbourhood of
Smithfield is by no means improved in its desirableness; it was bad enough
before, but nothing to what it is under the "Bull's new system." Now, young
Government clerks, who have to trudge "from the west," as they call it
(namely—Marylebone-lane, "Chesterfield-street, Portland-place," and so forth),
are highly indignant, and more than usually vituperative of the superiors of
their departments, whom they commonly describe (particularly if of a political
turn) as vile sinecurists, "grinding the last drop of blood from the brows of a
suffering people, to pay for their own pleasures, and to minister to their own
inordinate desires!" Now, nursemaids <em>not</em> "accustomed to the care of children"
(in a fog), suddenly find their tender charges minus divers coral necklaces,
ostrich feathers, gold lockets, &amp;c. &amp;c.; while the interesting young lady who
leads dear little Fido about the parks, in a string, and reads Lord Byron the
while, is horrified on finding that, for the last half hour, she has been engaged
in dragging after her a mere remnant of blue ribbon. Now, omnibus cads only
shake their heads in reply to your most earnest appeals and uplifted fingers,
for their vehicles are <em>all</em> full, and can take in "no more." Now, "blacks" come
down in torrents; and coal-heavers and chimney-sweepers are the only persons
that can show a decent face on the occasion. Now, wood pavements are in
nice condition; particularly that in the pleasing bend by St. Giles's church;

<p class='c000'>Now, housemaids do their work in no time; for it's of no use looking out for
raps from chamber windows. Now, on the 5th, little boys exhibit their Guys
in all parts of the town; and, on the 9th, "children of a larger growth" <em>make
Guys of themselves</em> all the way from Guildhall to Westminster and back. Now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>everybody has got a shawl, comforter, boa, or bandana, round his or her neck—except
the philosophers, who appear in respirators; the result of which is, that
the shawl, comforter, boa, and bandana-ites, escape scott free, while the philosophers
catch most confounded bad colds and sore throats. Now, unhappy is
that mamma who has a juvenile party for an excursion to the Monument; for,
of course, they'll all twelve cry their twenty-four little eyes out—equally if
they go and can't see anything, or are kept at home because nothing is to be
seen. Now, on the river is confusion worse confounded, and smuggling is
going on most prosperously in all its branches. Now, the "old traveller,"
just arrived by the Antwerp packet, who <em>will</em> carry his own portmanteau and
great coat, finds, on stopping to change arms, at the nearest post, that one or
other of the commodities has disappeared while he was comfortably adjusting
its fellow. Now, telegraph captains and weathercocks have a nice easy time of
it, and the guide to the York column is gone to see his cousins in the country.
Now, men with wooden legs look very independent, as they stump over the
slushy pavement; and people who have the misfortune to possess complete sets,
are sadly perplexed at the crossings of the Royal Exchange, Charing Cross, and
the Regent's Circus. Now, hare skins and worsted comforters are hung out
prominently at the haberdashers' shops, and furs, "at <em>this</em> season," are, by no
means, "selling at reduced prices." Now, the man "wot lights the lamps" in
St. James's Park, is in a regular state of bewilderment, and not unfrequently is
found running up one of the saplings instead of the lamp-post. Now, the
young gentleman who has an assignation in the "grove at the end of the vale,"
begins to wish he hadn't been quite so urgent in the matter, and would give
his ears for a decent excuse to be off the bargain. Now, honest John Sloman,
the grocer, at the corner of Cannon-street, in consideration of the werry orrid
state of the weather, is inveigled by his wife and daughter to visit one of the
promenade concerts; to which end, having never been at a <em>promenade</em> concert
before, honest John provides himself with a stout cane and his easy walking
boots, warranted to do four miles an hour over any turnpike-road in the kingdom.
Now, clubs are crammed, particularly the Oriental, where enormous fires
are kept up, and the chilly old nabobs cling round one another like bats in a
cellar. Now, as the plot (alias the fog) thickens, torches make their appearance;
first by dozens, then by dozens of dozens, then by dozens of dozens of
dozens: Charing-cross is as difficult to navigate as the North-west passage,
and the parks are impossible; hackney coaches drive up against church windows;
old men tumble down cellar holes: old women and children stand
crying up against lamp-posts, lost within a street of their own homes; omnibus
horses dash against one another, and are handed over to the knacker; a
gentleman, having three ladies and a young family of children to escort home
from Astley's (on foot, of course), is in a nice predicament; all the little boys
in London are out, increasing, by their screams and halloos, the bewilderment
of the scene (<em>scene</em>, did I say?); pickpockets are on the alert; ditto, burglars;
policemen are not to be found; watchmen are missing; in short, the whole town
is in such a state of commotion and panic, that it only requires a well-organized
banditti to carry off all London into the next county.</p>

<p class='c016'>Puddings, as well as people, begin to go to <em>pot</em>;
cooks, as well as drunkards, get their <em>coppers hot</em>.
Lemons excel hypocrites in getting <em>candid</em>: currants,
from house to house, like crooked legs, are <em>bandied</em>.
At moist sugar, instead of white, the busy servants
jump; and wisely begin to <em>like</em> that which they cannot
<em>lump</em>. Mothers who beat their children, whenever
the whim comes in their head, now actively betake
themselves to <em>beating eggs</em> instead. The family assemble,
but it's no longer "my lovely Rose," or my
sweet William, with his pretty stock, the <em>flour</em> of the
Christmas pudding is now the <em>flower of the flock</em>!
Father, the only one who never would to their low
obscurity demur, is now just as anxious as any to join
in a <em>general stir</em>. Ambition, alive in his breast, awakens
a mighty surprise, to think that he, who was always
<em>mincing matters</em>, should begin to <em>mince pies</em>! and they
prophesy, as he rakes the <em>plums</em>, in the bowl of China
or delf, that he'll live to a Christmas-day that shall
see him worth a <em>plum</em> himself. "How fond he is on 'em
all," says nurse, meaning to be clever; "I declare
he's a <em>mixing with his family</em> more than ever!" "Yes,
nurse," responds his spouse, who thought she could
do no less, "your master's acting the part of president
of the <em>family mess</em>!" and so on—nothing whatever
their placid temper a-spoiling, until the pudding's
made, and tied up, and shut down, and in the copper
a-boiling!</p>

<p class='c016'>Note now, oh! reader, the denotements of my prophet sketch:
open your eyes upon the symbols which I symbolize. Behold
the Cross and the Crescent in neighbourly collision; yet the Crescent
is not Burton Crescent, nor the Cross, King's Cross, though these
localities approximate in as close degrees: but they tell of Europe
cooking the Goose of a Pacha for the Turkey of a Sultan; and, by
this time, the bird is plucked and basted, and may be considered as
thoroughly done. Witness, too, how the dismayed tee-totaller
gazes on the wreck of the Chinese world below. But Bull is in the
heart of the shop; no juggler could save the jugs; every cup is a
cup too low; the plates are dished entirely, and the case of cruelty
is equal in atrocity to the murder of <em>Ware</em>. Now is exemplified
the difference between a Man-<em>da</em>rin and a daring man. It is breaking-up
time, but no holidays. Loud is the music of <em>Handle</em> among
the crockery, but its verbal oratory is demolished by the entire
annihilation of spout. It is going to <em>pot</em> with a vengeance, and
occasions, in China, the perfect distortion of <em>every human mug</em>. Tea,
however, is scarce for a season. They refuse to give us their green
for our gunpowder: they mix their mixed with poison, and it is
now "How queer!" instead of "How-<em>qua</em>!" They refuse the bidding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>of Pidding! But turn from hieroglyphic revealments to the
signs and prognostics of the domestic world. Is your curiosity
moved to interest in the play of Destiny? I then will act the part
of <em>Tell</em>. Upon the palace of Victoria I behold the shining of a new
<em>sun</em>; the hopes of royalty may now be <em>boy</em>-ed up, and a fair young
passenger lately arrived by the first royal <em>train</em> will move to another
<em>station</em>, and take a place lower, by reason of what has taken place.
I see the world settling, like cards, into <em>pax</em>. Peace coming a-<em>pace-is</em>:
war we shall pose with repose. The political horizon shows clear.
There will be an improvement in the State; and notwithstanding
the recent explosion of Dr. Church's engine, I foresee no danger to
Church. On the contrary, the sun will shine on Parson's Green;
and, as regards the revenue, there is every chance for a <em>surplice</em>;
probably owing to the New Church rate at which the said engine is
going.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>ORIGINAL NOTES.<br /> FROM THE<br /> BIRMINGHAM MUSICAL FESTIVAL <span class='fss'>FOR</span> 1840.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sept. 23.</span>—Birmingham Musical Festival.—Ordered a cab; made
for Euston-square Station; landed awkwardly; got into port; ran
against a man; trod on his toe; gave my own port-man-teau to the
porter. Paid my fare; had the satisfaction of hearing the clerk
say, "That's the ticket!" Was told I must be sure to shew it
when called upon; said, "Very well;" always did like to have something
to shew for my money. Travelled briskly; steam engine a
giant apparatus—a sort of Colossus of Roads; found they'd got me
into a line; couldn't help it; obliged to go; been a long while going.
Arrived at last; put up at the Hen and Chickens; thought, from
the sign of the house, charges might be fowl; agreeably surprised
to find them fair.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Monday.</em>—Attended rehearsal. Splendid hall; grand interior;
glorious outside; ruined the builders. Brought the stone from the
Isle of Anglesea; sent the architects to the Isle of Dogs. Good rehearsal;
noble orchestra; organ finely developed. Knynett acted
non-conductor; stamped as if he was paying stamp duty; very
droll; took the flats in, put the orchestra out. Glorious array of
singers: Miss Birch stuck to her perch; Miss Hawes obeyed the
laws; Dorus Gras—made no <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</span></i>; Braham's throat gave tenor
note; Phillips shone in barritone; big Lablache gave bass <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans tache</span></i>;
Cramer led with cap on head; Loder and Cooke played by book;
Dragonetti and Linley worked very well-o, on deep contra basso
and violoncello; bassoon of Beauman bothered <em>no</em> man; horn of
Platt came in pat; Harper's trumpet obligato, capitally took its
part-o; Cook played show-boy with his hautboy; and, to end without
a blunder, Chipp's drum had, its leather under, half a ton of smothered
thunder. Heard 'em play; remembered the railroad, and couldn't
help thinking that I'd got off the <em>line</em> into the <em>chords</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tuesday.</em>—Festival began. Shop full; a crammer for Cramer.
You've heard of the Chiltern Hundreds, they're nothing to the
Birmingham thousands. The seats were all uniform, but no uniform
for the <em>staff</em> officers, only ribbons in their button-holes; beaux
with bows. Singers came on, and performance went off admirably.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Wednesday.</em>—Town crowded; weather wet, but the people pouring
in faster than the rain; music hall made fine shelter; full
again; Mendelsohn's hymn of praise produced lots of praise of
him; people delighted; performance stupendous; singers tired;
Phillips almost knocked up; went out to refresh himself; strolled
too far, and was quite knocked down; robbed of his purse by three
brutal button-makers; he treated them to some sovereigns; they
treated him to an extra allowance of punch; he was bruised considerably,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>but his watch and his barritone escaped without injury;
heard a <em>tallow</em> chandler say, that Phillips and Mendelsohn were
the heroes of the day, but that Mendelsohn had the glory of the
<em>composition</em>, and Phillips of the <em>whacks</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thursday.</em>—Influx of nobility—nobs and bobs—Sir Robert Peel
among the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Friday.</em>—Festival over; grand fancy ball at night:</p>

<p class='c000'>Drinking, dancing, all revel, no rest; proggery, toggery, all of
the best; whisking, frisking, whirling about, till daylight comes,
driving the candle-light out: then tired, not fired, their pillows
they clinch, and the festival's come to its very last pinch.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH ILLUMINATI.</h3>

<p class='c008'>[<em>The following Extracts from the Proceedings of this illustrious Body,
at the Meeting of 1840, will be read, no doubt, with the interest they
deserve.</em>]</p>

<p class='c000'>Some very curious statistical and general reports were made by Mr. Colley
Wobble, on the street refreshments of London. It appeared that the proportion
of baked potatoe receptacles, or, as they were commonly termed,
"hot tator cans," over kidney-pudding stalls, was as six to one. Of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>cans one in seven was surmounted with lamps; one in three had a spare
valve, to let off steam; and five out of nine used condensed Dorset scrapings,
averaging about fourpence per pound. The kidney-pudding stalls appeared
to confine their stations to the neighbourhoods of the minor theatres, and he
could trace the effect of their nourishing principle in those thrilling and passionate
outbursts, which melodramatic actors threw into such phrases as—"It
<em>is</em> my daughter!" "Begone, sir! and learn not to insult virtuous
poverty;" and the like class. Some of the stalls were embellished with
singularly curious transparent lanterns, representing theatrical subjects on
their four sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bobbledabs inquired what species of light was burnt inside these
transparencies?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Colley Wobble defined it as produced by the combustion of atmospheric
air, acting on a half-consumed continuity of a twopenny thick, set in argillaceous
candlesticks. He was led to make these observations from having
perceived a hole burnt in the lantern, where the candle had tumbled over.
The learned gentleman added, in continuation, that one of the most favourite
exhibitions was "Kerim and Sanballat fighting for a kidney-pudding, from
Timour the Tartar." He had likewise observed William Tell shooting a
kidney-pudding from Albert's head, and Mr. Stickney riding five kidney-puddings
at once for a horse—he meant to say—that is—the Association
would know what he meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Snuffantupenny inquired if these piquant preparations were expensive?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Colley Wobble estimated the general price at one penny each. When
purchased, the vendor made a hole in them with the nail of his little finger,
and poured in some warm compound, out of a blacking-bottle, with a quill in
the cork. The liquid had been analyzed by Mr. Faraway, and was found to
contain one part fat, one part furniture oil, two parts infusion of melt, and
sixteen parts of hot water, with dirt in solution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gambado then read a talented paper on "The imaginary barrier precluding
pickled whelks from the tables of the aristocracy;" and having
finished, he begged to propose a Committee of Inquiry—why boiled crabs
were sold at three a penny in Union Street, Middlesex Hospital, when you
might purchase four, for the same sum, on Kennington Common?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bobbledabs trusted his talented friend would remember that Kennington
Common was nearer the sea-coast than Union Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gambado sat corrected. While they were on the subject, however,
he wished to say a few words on the connexion supposed to exist between
the anatomical school of the said hospital—that was to say, the Middlesex—and
the number of shops for the sale of old bones and doctors' phials, with
which Union Street abounded; and why so many dissecting cases were to
be seen in the window of the pop-shop at the corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Corfe thought the reason was obvious. The scalpels hybernated with
the watches towards the end of November, and the students were thus,
unavoidably driven to use penknives for lancets, and the small ends of tobacco-pipes
for probes and blowpipes.</p>

<p class='c000'>This elegant production was painted on a sheet of paper with a lace border,
and presented a singular mixture of sentiment and improbability, viz.—a little
boy, in a species of undress which the police would certainly prohibit from becoming
the general fashion, riding in a car, like an enormous periwinkle shell
turned topsy-turvy, upon wheels, and drawn by two pigeons—a proceeding of
which every thinking mind must admit the impracticability, since the atmospheric
resistance of the birds' wings could never afford sufficient fulcrum to
draw so large a vehicle with any momentum, especially with cowslip collars
and rosebud traces.—[See Proceed. of Chawturmut Lit. and Scien. Inst., p.
30.] A church with a pointed spire and two windows was seen in the distance,
perfecting this tasteful composition of protestant mythology. At each
corner were intricate red loops, like mud-worms in convulsions, termed true
lovers' knots; and below were eight exquisite and novel lines, of which we
present the reader with the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">termini</span></i>, leaving him to fill them up as he pleases:—"heart—smart,"
"languish—anguish," "flame—name," "you be mine—Valentine."</p>

<p class='c000'>What <em>do</em> you think? Mr. Pippy, the young apothecary, who came
down here to take our union of fourteen parishes at £20 a-year, has sent me
a Valentine. Not a common, impudent penny one of an old maid, with cats
and parrots all about her, but a beautiful picture of a little Cupid—such a
love!—riding in a thingemygig, drawn by two what-d'ye-call-'ems, with—oh,
my!—eight lovely verses underneath. I know it's from him, because it's
scented all over with the best Turkey rhubarb and oil of peppermint, and I
found a small piece of pill adhering to the envelope—how a trifle betrays the
secrets of the heart! My mind is all in a titter-totter—do come and see me.</p>

be taken immediately, and repeated every four hours with one of the powders?—alas!
I scarce know what I write. I have already directed a dozen
draughts to the wrong people: one old lady has swallowed half a pot of ringworm
ointment, and Mrs. Jones has been rubbing her little boy's head with
lenitive electuary. You alone can write the prescription that shall administer

<p class='c000'>We have given a small party, and he has formally proposed. He was
very timid at first, but it was the red wine negus that did it, for Mamma
very kindly made it pretty strong, and gave him a good dose, immediately
upon my singing—"I'd marry him to-morrow." He says he has loved me
"ever since he first saw me at church in that beautiful cloak." My dear, it
was my old pelisse, which I had turned, made into a capucine, and lined with
blue Persian; but love gilds everything by its magic: possibly it converted
my last year's straw bonnet into a Tuscan chip. It is pouring in torrents,
and they say if it goes on we must have a flood. He is sitting at his surgery
window, looking at me, between the red and blue bottles, with a spy-glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>How uncertain is everything in this world! I was to have been married
to-day to the loveliest of her sex, but the floods have so risen, that nothing but
the roof of the church is visible. It began yesterday morning, when the canal
banks broke, and increased with such rapidity, that I was compelled to spend
the day on the dining-table, and am now driven to the second floor, with no
provision but a flask of lamp oil and some tooth powder. The sick paupers of
the Union I attend have just arrived on a barge, which has got aground on the
bridge. The bell-ringers, also, who were practising in the belfry when the
irruption took place, are fast enclosed therein—the doors being under water,
and the windows too small to get out at. They are ringing for help, and the
sound is awfully painful, as it was to have been my bridal peal. A letter has
just been brought by Tom Johnson, in a mash-tub, from my adored Celia; I
hasten to read it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>(<em>From their Private Despatches.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is at all times a pleasing task to chronicle heroic deeds, and we hasten
to immortalize the proceedings of this gallant body of veterans during the
past year. Amongst their most daring and successful attempts, have been the
taking possession of Eel Pie Island; the storming of the baked apple-stand,
at Temple Bar; the blockade of Bolt-court, and the celebrated passage of the
Paddington Canal, under the direction of General Blackrag, the great city
undertaker, to whom the attack was entrusted, from his experience, as he
himself stated, in marching at the head of the <em>corps</em>. He was ably seconded
by his usual auxiliary, Dr. Bluelight, the former providing the <em>shells</em>, and the
latter the <em>mortars</em>, the combined effects of which produced terrific execution.
From the usual habits of the troop, it may readily be conceived that <em>counter</em>
marching was the manœuvre at which they felt most at home; in fact, the
only idea they had of "a regular <em>march</em>," was the one between February and
April. During their encounters, they have given and taken no quarter, except
an occasional fore one of lamb; whilst their undaunted courage was well
shown in the speech of Ensign Miggins, who declared "that he would never
shrink from coming to the <em>pint</em>, even against a rampart of <em>quartz</em>;" and his
unshaken energy in bearing <em>the standard</em> was never known to <em>flag</em>, firm as its
contemporary in Cornhill. Their acknowledged love of card-playing having
induced some unpleasant gambling transactions, it has been resolved, by the
head of the members, to prevent all legs from bearing arms in their body;
and a late regulation orders the colour of their plumes to be a deep crimson,
not only as emblematical of blood and glory, but from its precluding the possibility
of any one, at any time, <em>showing a white feather</em>. It is truly delightful
to contemplate the harmony which reigns amongst them at present; and it
it somewhat remarkable, considering their aptitude for <em>catches</em> of all sorts,
that they have made no prisoners. The only approach to anything like discord
in the troop, was upon the occasion of the dispute relative to a contemplated
attack upon Burgundy and Madeira; but even this added to the general
harmony, since, although the dinner service was demolished in the contention,
this one war was productive of one hundred <em>peaces</em>; and it furthermore enabled
the members to present to their friends several unique <em>pieces of plate</em>, at a
small outlay. We are indebted to their laureate for the following—</p>

      <div class='line'>At the fine church of Auch, which you know is in France.</div>
      <div class='line'>Next, into the famed Polytechnic we dropp'd,</div>

<h3 class='c007'>REGISTER OF INVENTIONS FOR 1841.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Some excitement has been caused among the learned bodies on the
Continent, by the discovery of a new Chlorine Bleaching Fluid, of
novel and unexampled powers, the invention of which is due to Professor
Jügler, of Scampsburgen. Not only has it the power of
removing the most permanent stains from a person's character, but
it also clears the most muddy conscience in the course of a few
applications; and a small quantity applied to the head as a lotion
is gradually absorbed and filters through the brain, removing in its
course all unpleasant reminiscences and uncomfortable thoughts.
Its mollifying powers have been tested on a number of the hardest
substances, including the heart of a metaphysician, which, in a few
seconds, it entirely humanized. Diluted with water, and sprinkled
on the floor, it purifies Houses of Parliament, Lawyers' Offices,
Private Lunatic Asylums, Cheap Schools, and Race-course Betting-stands;
and, used medicinally, a few drops, taken internally, blunt
the intellect, and if administered before a trial, will totally destroy
any <em>souvenir</em> of a former event that it may be deemed advisable to
get rid of in a principal witness. We ought in justice to add, that
the Mnemonic Tincture was also the discovery of the talented Jügler,
which is equally useful in causing persons to recollect things that
never happened at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Photographic Portraits. Whilst the Adelaide Gallery and Polytechnic
Institution of London are vying with each other for superiority
in producing those remarkably pleasant-looking and cheerful
representations, Mons. Le Cœur, of Paris, has adopted his new
system of taking them, which it seems he addresses especially to
young engaged people. The optical structure of the human eye, it
is well known, forms a Camera Obscura, by whose action the lineaments
of the loved one are correctly stamped upon the heart. The
chief difficulty has been experienced in fixing the picture so formed;
for it appears that, <em>after</em> marriage, there are few, if any, traces of
the features that were impressed there <em>before</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the Patents taken out during the past year, the Polyglossographic
Adamant Steel Pen ranks high in estimation. It is
particularly recommended to the notice of the public, for the facility
with which it enables people, not only to write in any language
they like, but to transcribe with grammatical elegance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Parvenu Medium Point is invaluable to those ladies and
gentlemen who have experienced a sudden rise in their fortunes; as
it saves them from exposing their want of education to their
epistolary friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Platino-Zincoid Poetical Nib will write Stanzas to Mary,
and lines to a Moss Rose, in any quantity; peculiarly adapted for
Albums and Fashion Books. To paid, regular contributors to
Annuals and Magazines, who revel in the mill-horse style of writing,
it will be found of incalculable advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Romance Rhodium Quality will furnish tales for newspapers
at a column an hour, varying in thrilling intensity, or historical
epoch, according to the ink used, which may, it appears, be procured
with the pens. The Newgate Writing Fluid is the most popular
at present.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Patent Circumslogdollagizing Leader Pen will prove highly
advantageous to gentlemen of the Public Press, from the facility
with which it produces leading articles on any popular theme. We
had the satisfaction of trying a Corn Law pen, which answered
admirably; and we hear the ingenious inventor has manufactured
Chartist, Commentary, and Abusive pens, on the same principle, as
well as Review Nibs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Engineer of the North-south-east-western Counties Railway
undertook, for a trifling wager, to travel at the rate of twenty miles
a second, and actually arrived at the appointed station some time
before he quitted the terminus! He states that this intense velocity
is obtained by using gin and water in the engine, instead of water
alone, which imbues it with a species of temporary intoxication.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Leviathan</em> steamship, to run between England and America,
will be launched early in the Spring. Great fears are, however,
entertained as to whether there will be room enough in the Atlantic
for her to turn round, without damaging her bowsprit between
Liverpool and New York.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Bailie Mucklescratch dwelt at Glasgow, in the Candleriggs. He was
what is called a "warm" man; that is, one who had rubbed on well in the
world, as indeed it is probable most of his customers did, the Scots being a
people celebrated for playing the rubber of life. The baillie kept, in American
phraseology, a "store"—in London vernacular, a chandler's shop; a bazaar,
whose staple consisted of oatmeal and red herrings, esculents in great esteem
north of Tweed. It has long been the opprobrium of philosophy that no
satisfactory reasons have been assigned for the proneness, in Caledonia,
towards porridge and salt fish. With unqualified satisfaction the announcement
is here made that their large pewter Minerva medal will be presented,
at the next meeting of the British Association, for the best treatise on the
"causes and effects" of a taste, evident on the most superficial glance at the
natives of that country. He also kept an only son, Sandy Macalister Mucklescratch,
who kept——but that is not part of our present affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, though the elder Mucklescratch evinced no ambition in selecting a
worldly position for himself, he had an <em>itching</em> about the appearance of his
<em>heir</em>. To this end, after a course of "humanities" at home, he consigned
him to a member of the College of Surgeons, an establishment renowned for
the sobriety and decorum of its disciples. No youth since the days of
Esculapius was ever in so fair a way to dignify the profession of medicine as
the young Glasgovian, if his own account was to be believed; and who was
so likely to possess the real facts of the case? To be sure, the honour was
not attained free of expense; but could it enter even the heart of a Scottish
chandler to suppose that his son might carve at the same table with Sir
Benjamin Brodie, or Sir Astley Cooper, without sharing the cost of the entertainment.
Day by day <em>accounts</em> arrived from the medical student; those
who observed their effects upon the receiver might have concluded they were
not quite satisfactory; but what could be expected from an old fellow who
lived upon "cock-a-leekie" in the Candleriggs? Fortunately, some of these
letters have been preserved; we copy one, to show the progress made by the
writer in other composition as well as that peculiar to <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Materia Medica</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c020'>"Governor,—Science can't be purchased without dibbs. When we want
<em>subjects</em>, we must <em>shell-out</em>. My share, for next lecture night (as there will
only be four of us), will take the shine out of a ten pound stiff. Send the
price of the spread, old trump, to your dutiful son,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c023'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<span class='sc'>Sandy</span>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>However well calculated such studies might have been to procure <em>patients</em>
for the son, they dealt differently with the <em>patience</em> of the father. Indeed, it
can hardly be held unreasonable that a man who had existed for half a century
on fourpence a day should feel a little disposed to inform himself how ten
sovereigns could be required for the fourth of a supper bill. Full of this
natural curiosity, the man of <em>groats</em> went to Edinburgh, embarked <em>smack</em> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>London, and presently domiciled himself on a lower floor in the neighbourhood
of Upper Gower Street, where, as the bill in the window implied, "gentlemen
were taken in, and done for." The traveller was weary: with his
nightcap mounted, and his chamber's light ignited, he was about to seek
Nature's restorer. What scared him from his purpose?</p>

<p class='c000'>The clock had told ten, and in the drawing-room apartments vertical, four
of the "Won't-go-home-till-morning" club assembled to pass the <em>day</em>. "Gentlemen,"
shouted the chairman, "here's <span class='fss'>CONFUSION TO ALL ORDER</span>! Now the
Charter chant, if you please, with honours." Then rose the company, and
while each executed a rigadoon to his particular taste, all pealed forth in
chorus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Long life to jolly drinking!</div>
      <div class='line'>Send round the wine like winking:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The liquor's free,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And so are we—</div>
      <div class='line'>Hurrah! for jolly drinking!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus, from night to morn the carouse continued, and each returning sun
was the signal for its repetition. There was but a choice of evils for the
ground-floor tenant—to remain where he was, and be killed by the inch, or
rather, <em>by the foot</em>, or pay a se'nnight's rent for a night's lodging—which
would have <em>despatched him</em> at once. All day did the miserable meal-man
seek his hopeful, with sorrow, and no success, and all night (truth compels
the confession) over the sire's head did the son perform the dance of death.
A shocking bad life was "Sandie" leading: both the elder and the younger
Scot were pursuing the M.D. after a fashion <em>Maximé Deflendum</em>. The
week ended, leaving the Glasgow magistrate with just enough of life to assist
him back to the Candleriggs. A trusty friend in the Great Metropolis, however,
was commissioned to discover the retreat of the prodigal, and compass
his restoration to the disconsolate parent. After a time, and a rigid stoppage
of supplies, this was effected; and Macalister Mucklescratch's career of dissipation
ended, as many a similar course has terminated, in <em>his being sent to
the Old Baillie</em>!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>Far north as he was born, the ancient Scot had a warm heart. Kindness
worked its accustomed office; and it was not long before the prodigal son
became the pride and comfort of his father's house. A pleasant thing it is
to see the pair seated together, and hear the old man, with glistening eyes,
repeat his especial <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</span></i>. "Eh, Sandie, my lad, when you and I were

  <h3 class='c007'>THE SHOP AND THE SHAY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>"Our life is twofold," Byron says; and it's very certain that we pass an
equal part before and behind the curtain;—from the chandler, whose trade's
his prop, and contrives, all the week, to stop behind the counter of his <em>shop</em>,
in the midst of red-herrings and split peas, French eggs, Prussian blue, Irish
butter, and Dutch cheese, with many other articles similar to these—but
Sunday he gives up to ease; and, "cutting the cheese" for the day, with his
<em>shay</em>, makes a little display, and off for a trip drives away, with his wife in a
toilet most gay, to 'bide by his side, with the pride of a bride, for a ride where
their own wishes guide.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then there's the gentleman some folks call a fop, who lodges very near the
house-top, and dines off a solitary chop, in a coat too worn even to pop, and
which no old clothesman would swop—<em>that's the shop!</em>—Then he turns out a
dandy complete, to swell up and down Regent Street, with neat polished boots
on his feet, not in dread of the friends he may meet, nor anxious to shuffle away—<em>that's
the shay!</em></p>

<p class='c000'>And next, Mrs. Brown, in a fright, that her seventeen daughters, in spite
of their figures so slight, and eyes bright, do not marry as fast as they might,
determines her friends to unite, and sends out to each an invite; and all the
day's in a sad plight, herself putting up each wax light, in order that all may
go right, as she trusts the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blanc mange</span></i> will be white, and not spoilt by her
own oversight; and, by evening, is ready to drop—<em>that's the shop!</em>—And
when night comes, rewarding their pains, her daughters, in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousselain-de-laines</span></i>,
with flushed cheeks and quick-throbbing veins, to the cornet-à-piston's
shrill strains, are flying about with their swains, whom they hope to entrap
in their chains, as fast as a set of mail trains; and all is as gay as a bright
summer day—<em>that's the shay!</em></p>

<p class='c000'>And the young opera <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></i>, who goes to learn how to walk on her toes,
or study each elegant <em>pose</em>, to an audience of empty pit rows, in her toilet
of everyday clothes, with her cheeks pale as death, and her nose, from the
cold, almost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couleur de rose</span></i>, the which she incessantly blows, as she goes
through each posture and hop—<em>that's the shop!</em>—And, at night, from her
place at the wing, she comes on the stage with a spring, and plaudits throughout
the house ring, at the sight of so sylph-like a thing, and her lover's the
son of a king, round whose neck her white arms fondly cling, until pulled aloft
by a string, she floats on a bright canvas sunbeam away—<em>that's the shay!</em></p>

<p class='c000'>And the poor scribbling author, whose will is a few brilliant thoughts to
distil, that may flow with his ink from his quill: who grinds his brains just
like a mill, in his garret deserted and chill, and thinks till he makes himself
ill, in the hopes that his pockets may fill, when the publisher praises his skill,
and who trusts, from his efforts, to reap a good crop—<em>that's the shop!</em>—And
when his said work proves a hit, and the sharpest reviewers admit, that it
shows many traces of wit, and he's thought for their <em>coteries</em> fit, and soon of

  <h3 class='c007'>MISERIES ENOUGH FOR THE YEAR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>To find it a rapid thaw when you have purchased a new pair of skates,
and have invited a party of ladies to see your performance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Getting soaked through, on your way to the Epping Hunt, and being told
that you have only taken your share of the Easter-<em>dews</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Driving your feet hastily into a pair of new Wellingtons, in order not to
miss the train (time and boots a tight fit), and finding, by the feel, that the
straps are at their bottoms;—boot-jack not to be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being asked to dine, on a New-year's day, with a family, in which the
children always expect presents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking a box at a theatre for the express purpose of hearing the wonderful
new vocalist, and finding, when you get there, only "indisposition" and a
stale comedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being "not at home" to an old friend, and coming downstairs, in a forgetful
fit, before he has had time to leave the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bowing, in your usual bland and affable manner, to a gentleman in the street,
whom you recollect, as soon as he has passed, that you ought to have kicked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Popping the question" in a pair of tight boots; the lady seeming in no
hurry, and to enjoy your agony.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going out to be godfather, and remembering, at the proper crisis for presentation,
that you must have left "the" silver cup in some omnibus.</p>

<p class='c000'>To be interrupted while writing a Bill-et-doux, by the recollection of a bill
over due.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being asked to carve, if you are a musician or literary man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being compelled, in a party, to sit down to whist; and hearing your
favourite part in an Italian quartet, which you had studied for a week before,
sung by a murderous wretch whom you long to strangle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Writing an <em>appointment</em> to a lady, and a <em>disappointment</em> to a tailor, and
cross-directing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paying your rent punctually, on quarter-day, to <em>your</em> landlord, and being
distrained on the next day by <em>his</em> landlord.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having ascertained, by a peep down your friend's area, that there is a
turkey on the spit, and calling, accidentally, of course, about dinner-time, you
feel rather sheepish when the cold mutton is brought up, and learn, in the
course of the evening, that the kitchen fire had been lent for the dinner party
of the next-door neighbour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Abusing a person whom you have never seen, to a respectable-looking
stranger, who, after apparently nodding assent, with the patience of a martyr,
quietly observes that <em>he is the man</em>. The unpleasant anticipation of loose
teeth, as you see him making up his <em>bunch of fives</em>.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>UP HILL AND DOWN DALE:</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>NARRATIVE OF AN ASCENT TO THE SUMMIT OF PRIMROSE HILL.</div>
    <div>BY MESSRS. POPKINS AND VULT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The celebrated Primrose Hill, which is estimated to be nearly one hundred
feet above the level of the Regent's Canal, forms one end of the great chain
of the Metropolitan Alps, which comprises the respective hills of Highgate,
Ludgate, Snow, Saffron, Mutton, Addle, Tower, Corn, Constitution, and
many other peaks. Whilst the enterprises of Sherwill, Clarke, De Saussure,
Auldjo, and others, had carried them to the summit of Mont Blanc, and M.
Agassiz had overcome the hitherto impracticable Jungfrau, and given their
published accounts to the world, it is somewhat strange that no narrative
has hitherto been published of the ascent of Primrose Hill. To supply this
void in our literature, as well as to furnish an account to Peter Parley, which,
in the event of his refusing, I should have sent to the "Penny Magazine,"
I was induced to undertake the excursion. Although the time of year was
somewhat against me, yet, from the noble offer of Mr. Vult, whom I met
casually in the diving-bell at the bottom of the tank in the Polytechnic Institution,
I determined, at all risks, to make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>On inquiry, we found that the charity boys of the district schools were best
acquainted with the localities, and we therefore engaged four of them as
guides. Their parents did not seem to comprehend our intentions, but possibly
this arose from reluctance to allow their children to join our venture:
but we overcame their scruples by offers of liberal payment, and named the
eldest ("Plucky Simmuns" as he was familiarly termed by his fellows) as
our chief guide. We also contracted with a broom merchant in Kentish
Town for our ice-poles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning at nine o'clock, and in a deep snow, we left the Albany
Tavern, amidst a crowd collected to see us start; and crossing some palings
and a piece of broken ground, prepared to ascend. Our progress soon became
one of extreme peril, as the snow had been collected from Park Village,
and shot out on this waste, forming vast hills, which required great labour
to surmount. Once I completely stuck fast, and before I was extricated
nearly left one of my cloth boots behind me. Our respiration also became
very difficult, evidently from the rarefaction of the air at so great a height,
although Mr. Vult persisted in attributing it to the hot rolls we had eaten
at breakfast. We crossed this large confusion of snow, which we presumed
to be part of the Chalk Farm Glacier, and were astonished, on arriving at the
opposite side, to see a man in these wild solitudes. He was evidently a
child of the mountain, and proffered for sale an article he termed "ginger
cocktail," which he assured us would prove most palatable. We bought
some, and went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conduct of our guides was most remarkable: in circumstances of the
utmost peril they betrayed a levity almost unnatural, and more than once
took to snowballing each other, as if they had been on level ground. We
continued to ascend until the dreary waste of the Hill opened on us in all
its awful grandeur. No living thing was visible, and the earth below was
fading in the misty distance, leaving no trace of its existence but the tops
of the tall chimneys on the Birmingham Railway. Once, and once only, Mr.
Vult fancied he heard the squeak of a train coming in: this might or might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>not have been the case. The cold was most intense, but we had made up
our minds to succeed or die, and we pushed bravely up the last slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>At half-past eleven we reached the summit—and never shall I forget the
eventful moment. My companions partook of my excitement, with the exception
of Mr. Vult, who having had the care of the brandy flask in the
ascent, and not being a teetotaller, had indulged in so many tastes, that his
conduct was most unscientific. He insisted on trying to waltz with Simmons,
and threw his new hat at a bird that flew over our heads. A passing
breeze carried it down the Hill with as much ease as if it had been its namesake
production of the fields—the work of the <em>Aranea Sylvestris</em>, or Gossamer
Spider of Linnæus.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the view, so dense was the fog reigning around, that we
saw nothing beyond twenty yards from us. What lay within that radius
was, however, very magnificent, consisting of a deep layer of snow, broken
only by our footsteps. In answer to my inquiry of Simmons, if avalanches
were common in the winter, he replied, with much candour, "That he didn't
disactly know, but he believed there was lots of nuts and brandy-balls, now
and then." Having satisfied our eyes, we prepared to act similarly towards
our stomachs: and we were glad to find our elevated situation had no other
effect upon our animal economy than wonderfully increasing our appetites.
The guides feasted at a small distance from us; their provision consisted
principally of cold bacon, which they had tied up in their neckcloths, where
it acted as a stiffener. We allowed a bottle of Guinness amongst them,
fearing, if we gave them more, they would get confused, and unable to find
their way down again. After dinner I proposed "Prosperity to Science,"
which Mr. Vult insisted upon giving with three times six, and finished by
falling down on the snow, quite overcome. The sentiment given by Plucky
was simple, and indicative of pastoral feeling. He merely exclaimed, as he
slapped his hand against his yellow-leather indispensables, "Here's luck!"
and drank up nearly all the bottle at a draught, to show how much in earnest
he was.</p>

<p class='c000'>I wrote some notes in pencil for our friends to keep as <em>souvenirs</em>, and made
several scientific observations. On endeavouring to ascertain, from the fall
of the mercury in my barometer, at what height we stood, I was surprised
to see no traces at all of the mercury on the index plate. I subsequently
found Mr. Vult had tumbled on it, and all the quicksilver had run out.</p>

<p class='c000'>As afternoon advanced we prepared to descend, dreading lest night should
overtake us in these wild solitudes. Our guides showed us a method of
coming down the declivities, at which they seemed very expert. They sat
on the snow, and glided down with the rapidity of a railroad. Not liking to
trust myself alone, Plucky took me behind him, and we got down safely. Mr.
Vult, however, over valiant, would go by himself, and consequently, after
sliding at a fearful rate, he suddenly disappeared, having, as we imagined,
slipped into some tremendous crevice of the glacier. We found that he had
fallen into a hole where the railway navigators had been digging for clay,
the water in which had got slightly frozen over, and then covered with snow.
This accident somewhat checked our ardour, but we congratulated ourselves
upon its fortunate result. At length we reached the level ground, and returned
to our inn, highly gratified with our excursion, although we would
recommend no one to undertake so perilous a task from mere motives of
curiosity.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>SOCIETY FOR THE CONFUSION OF USELESS<br /> KNOWLEDGE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>August, 1841.</span>—At the Annual Meeting of the British Fill-us-off-ical
and Feeding Association, at Ply-mouth, the following ingenious plan was
promulgated—for a Company for the Confusion of Useless Knowledge. It
is needless to say that so praiseworthy a project met with the unbounded
sympathy and concurrence of all the members present.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is intended by the Company to supply the present enormous mental
appetite of the public with a full feed of science and literature in a series
of sixpenny bits, or bites. To prevent the appetite from becoming cloyed
by too continuous a fare of any one kind, the bits will be so intermingled
and diversified as to keep the biters always expecting and never satisfied.
Thus, the biography of Bacon will be relieved by a bit of the history of
Greece; a bit of Astronomy, by a bit of Brewing; a bit of Roman History,
by a bit of Algebra; a bit of Chemistry, by a bit of Commerce; a bit of
the History of the Church, by a bit of Sir Christopher Wren. Vegetable
Physiology, bit I., will be probably followed by a Treatise on Probability;
from the study of which the reader may, if he please, try to find out when
he is likely to see Vegetable Physiology, bit II. The whole will thus form,
in the mind of the student, a most desirable complication of the Novum
Organon, Athens, Malting and Mash-tubs, the Cæsars, Logarithms, Oxygen,
Tariffs, Telescopes, the Arian Controversy, the building of St. Paul's, Cellular
Tissues, and Reversionary Interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>The success of various topographical works, which, in their periodical
production, illustrate perhaps a description of Northumberland, with views
in Norfolk or Middlesex; and of the Encyclopædias, which accompany the
article Entomology, with probably the plates of Clockwork, or Geometry,
justify the Company in adopting a similar mode of arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Company propose, in order to insure the greatest possible degree of
ultimate perfection, to commence some of the subjects with bits, developing
the present notions of the scientific world, and to keep them incomplete till
they can conclude them with the discoveries of the next generation on the
same topics; so that the statements in bit No. 1 will probably be corrected
by the subsequent discoveries in bit No. 2 of the same subject, to be produced
ten years hence; but, considering the philanthropic views of the
Company, they will consider themselves quite at liberty to abandon, incomplete,

</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Green is, with all deference to the gentleman of another colour who
generally assumes that title, the real Prince of the Air. He rides upon the
whirlwind where he lists: the atmosphere welcomes him with <em>hail</em>! and the
bridled tempest offers him its <em>rains</em>. If the perfection of the science of
aërostation be so perfectly within his grasp, it is plain the <em>elements</em> must long
since have yielded: he knows all their economies, and regards the zephyrs as
familiar airs. The mischievous wind, so often presuming on its intangibility,
by committing all sorts of depredations, and then scudding off, is compelled
to confess its inability to cope with him, and to own the presence of "Green
in its eye." Hecate is, compared to him, a dull, powerless agent; for his
spirits do not wait for him on the rather uncertain tenement of a foggy
cloud—which, from its surchargement with aqueous vapour in suspension,
stands a chance of converting them into weak grog—but lie neck and heels
at the bottom of his car, assimilating, in their nature, to bottle imps. When
other people call a coach he unconcernedly takes a fly, and floats up like
down. Other blessings attend his aërial wanderings. His champagne and
stout are sure to be <em>up</em>; his cold pheasant is palatably <em>high</em>; and his other
refreshments range far <em>above</em> all imitations. He takes leave of the world, not
as an anchorite, but to enter a livelier grade of superior society, moving in an
elevated position; and bears with philosophical indifference the wide reverses
of his existence, from the most rapid rise to a subsequent decline and fall;
although, at the same time, no man has more uniformly good prospects. We
only wonder how he can tolerate our dull earth, and wager he never feels so
secure with the flags of the pavement as he does with those of his own
balloon. His very nature must have been reduced to what it works in—the
atmosphere: and those who may eventually succeed to his possessions can be
no other than the Airshire legatees. The rise and fall of the stocks affect him
not—his own keep pace with his situation; and the glance of his eye sweeps
the whole range beneath him with <em>a bird's-eye wipe</em>. There are but few
difficulties on earth that he cannot grapple with. His balloon is his substantial
and impregnable castle in the air, which he has built himself: and
he always has his wits about him cool and collected, though, like a wool-gathering
ruminator, he is constantly in the clouds. Although Mr. Green
was long connected with the Polytechnic Institution, where his aëronautic
whirligigs used to demonstrate the power he had acquired in guiding balloons,
we are convinced he never went down in a diving-bell, for he would have
been literally out of his element; unless the galvanic experiments at the
same time could have chemically decomposed the water around it into its
constituent gases, and he would then have gone aloft with his darling hydrogen.
We once saw him contemplating the diving-bell; but it was with the air
of an eagle of the sun gazing at a dabchick, apparently lost in wonder, not
at the machine, but at the eagerness of the visitors to descend in it, to the
chilly depths of the tank. It was evident that he no more regarded them as
of his own species than the brilliant <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">libellula</span></i>, rising in the sunshine, owns
the immature chrysalis lying at the bottom of the pool.</p>

<p class='c000'>We ourselves, who are not a prey to such flights of ambition, hold the
Polytechnic Institution, and its million wonders, in especial reverence from
beginning to end, and think it fortunate that its professors live in enlightened
times, or they would be assuredly burnt for necromancers, and form their own
fire-clouds; producing photographic shadows of themselves, by the glare of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>their own faggots. Not being inclined to soar aloft, we rather approve of the
diving-bell, and often pay it a visit. It affords matter of gratification to
everybody. The scientific man goes down to measure the pressure of the
atmosphere upon the drums of his ears, and see the displacement of water by
air; the sightseer and curiosity-hunter, to experience a novel sensation;
the hair-brained lounger, fresh from Regent-street, with his little stick and
blotting-paper-coloured Chesterfield, to "put up a lark," although the bottom
of a tank of water is certainly rather an unlikely place to find such a
creation; and the lover of display, to gratify a trifle of ambition in becoming
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro-tempore</span></i> lion of the place, as he emerges from the bell on its emersion
from the water, in the bright eyes of the pretty girls who are looking down
on his sub-aqueous venture from the galleries above.</p>

<p class='c000'>The diving-bell, in the present era of compound-progressive science, is only
in its infancy—its tinkle will, ere long, be changed to a toll: we speak
metaphorically, and do not allude to the shilling paid for entrance. We have
passed the adventures in the picture which illustrate the article "<span class='sc'>Bell</span>-Diving,"
in the Encyclopædias, representing two gentlemen, who have
secured places inside, holding air-tubes, and one, more venturesome, who has
strolled to take a <em>cold without</em>, carrying a small bell on his head, and a boat-hook
in his hand, amidst rocks and sea-weeds. Bolder schemes are in progress.
The bell will open a new line for travellers to the Antipodes, by going
right through the sea at once, and thus curtailing the journey by the
geometrical relation which the diameter bears to half the circumference.
Neither should we be surprised if people, addicted to go down to watering-places,
go down at once to the very bottom, and choose waterproof summer
villas on the beds of our lakes and rivers, exempt from land-tax and ground-rent;
when, stationed in the water, they fling defiance at the law of the
land. Such a position would be a fitting site whereon Father Mathew and
his proselytes could erect a temple to the Genius of Teetotalism.</p>

<p class='c000'>We need not add, it will take some time to bring the public mind to an
idea of the security of these abodes. The shilling'sworth of flurry and ear-ache
which the adventurers purchase so readily, still, however, finds a
rapid sale. We descended the other day with a lady who had a great
deal of the former commodity for her money. Her fright was extreme,
when the huge monster that contained us first swung off its perch; and,
when its mouth touched the water, she gave way to the wildest despair,
even to attempt breaking the windows with her parasol. The only moment
of security she experienced was when she reached the bottom. Here she fairly
jumped down off her seat, on which it had required great exertion to retain
her, and begged to be left where she was, now she had once reached the
ground again, observing, we might go back in the bell if we chose, but, for
her part, she preferred substantial footing to again trusting herself in such a
crack-me-crazy vehicle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The indefatigable Mr. Swallow has obligingly forwarded to us
the following list of valuable relics, which were rescued from the
"devouring element," during the late conflagration at the Tower:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Half of the lid of a pot, inscribed—"<em>Fox's</em> Circassian Cream,"
and supposed to have belonged to <em>Renard</em>, the Spanish Ambassador
at the Court of Queen Mary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The handle of the warming-pan which was used for the bed of
the young princes the night previous to their being smothered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bowl of the identical pipe with which the executioner of
Guy Fawkes composed himself, after he had accomplished his
unpleasant duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>A portion of a bottle, which contained the liquid used to polish
the Bluchers of Edward the Black Prince; part of the label, with
the letters <span class='fss'>WAR</span>——still in high preservation, and clearly indicating
the determined resolution of that undaunted hero.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tile, with the initials "W.R.," and which, it is judged from
the caligraphy, belonged to the time of William <em>Roof</em>-us.</p>

<p class='c000'>A massive trowel, the state of its edge proving that there must
have been a "<em>strike</em>" of Masons in former days.</p>

<p class='c000'>A spice-box, supposed to have contained the <em>mace</em> of the ancient
Lord Mayors of London.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fragment of a Cigar, very probably a portion of the <em>Regalia</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A five-shilling piece, in an imperfect state; doubtless the <em>crown</em>
that Richard the Second resigned to Henry of Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c000'>A constable's truncheon, with a certificate of its having formed
the Duke of Wellington's <em>staff</em> at Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c000'>The feet of the gridiron that cooked the last <em>chop</em>, but one, for
the ill-fated Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p class='c000'>A <em>pitch</em>-er, used by the <em>tars</em> to drink grog out of, after the dispersion
of the Spanish Armada.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>GOING! GONE!<br /> THE AUCTION-HERE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Glasses, tables, pictures, chairs, Dutch ovens, and beds;—and
knots of men upon the stairs, with knots upon their heads;—and
the dining-room table put in the front drawing-room, and covered
by the back parlour carpet,—supporting the auctioneer, and the
clerk, and catalogues, and desk, altogether enough to warp it.—And
each hale porter stout is "drawing lots" about, which, if brittle,
you may think fortunate, if from the room they are thrust whole,—from
the specimen post of the best front bed, and the <em>book</em> muslin
covers, that once were <em>red</em>, to the cinder-sieve and knife-board, in
the dust-hole.—"Any advance upon seven—eight, nine, ten, eleven—going!—thank
you, sir—twelve, thirteen. Tap! gone for thirteen—the
cheapest bargain ever seen; they are yours, sir; if you pay,
they may go at once away. Six iron hoops, a water-butt, a bottle-rack,
and broom."—"Oh, Mr. Auctioneer, there's some mistake, I
fear, for not a word I said."—"But, sir, you nodded your head."—"Oh,
yes, to a friend in the room!"—And when the sale of the
silver things is going to begin, the room's so hot, and the crowd
so dense, from the people scrowdging in;—and the struggle for the
loss is so great 'mongst those who compete, that you'd say there
was a race for the plate in a general heat.—And there's a great
Jew upholder, that I'm forced to uphold on my shoulder—leaning
upon my chair, with long, black, greasy hair, that would make Sir
Peter Laurie swear, and a coat as rough as a bear; it's rather too
bad to let him in amongst respectable people, in his <em>bear</em>-skin;
and I don't know what he can mean, but I suppose it's his fat that
makes him <em>lean</em>.—"Ladies and gentlemen, I must beg silence,—for
the babel of your tongues may be heard a mile hence.—I first offer
to your notice an article of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertu</span></i>, as old as the world itself, both
curious and rare too, that was dug up beneath some ruins in the
Sicilies,—and is from the undoubted chisel of Praxiteles—representing
a Venus, without legs, arms, or head; <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au reste</span></i>,—the <em>trunk</em> is
very beautiful, so is the <em>chest</em>."—"Mr. Auctioneer, your classic
knowledge is rather queer; and I don't wish to hurt you, but I
cannot understand Venus being an article of <em>virtue</em>; and if this
mutilated image is Venus coming from the sea, as you say, I
should rather incline to think that the sharks had been following in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>her lee all the way."—"We have here a fine painting by Vandyke,—a
correct portrait of anybody you like—and a bust of the celebrated
ballad-singer, Homer,—who, throughout the towns of Greece, was
a roamer,—where 'tis known, by even the most illiterate dunce,
that he'd the luck to be born in seven different cities at once;—but
all his endeavours to raise a penny from each of these places
seemed to fail,—for he never got out-door relief from any, although
it seems to have been a Union on a most extensive scale.—I'll
thank you to give me a good bidding, if you please—for you rarely
see such authentic originals as these—which I have offered to the
gaze of the beholders.—The bust upon which you have all bent your
eyes was buried in Pompeian lava for centuries,—where it, all that
time, had lain."—"Then, perhaps, sir, you can explain the meaning
of the motto 'Austin and Seeley,' on the shoulders."—And in the
midst of this general din the rafters of the floor all tumble in,—and
down to the parlour the company and auctioneer go,—which rather
cumflusticates those who are sitting below; and so,—amidst
the general confusion and rout,—we ourselves will contrive to
scramble out—from the room in which we were crammed;—and, on
gaining the fresh air, we are almost tempted to swear, if we go
there again we'll be—shot!</p>

<p class='c016'>No third-floor front that ever looked upon the golden waters of Ball's
Pond harboured swain more favoured by nature and art than the young
Augustus Kutitphat. His father was the renowned Orlando Kosenem Von
Kutitphat who, passing over from Germany to this country in three ships,
became <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbiter elegantiarum</span></i> at Hockley-in-the-Hole, and his mother was
nearly related to that unprecedented Simpson who conferred immortality
upon the bowers of Vauxhall. At the age of nineteen Augustus was
bereaved of his parents, from whom he inherited a mine of brass (in his
face), and a harvest of curls (<em>hair</em>-looms) unparalleled in the annals of
(Bear's) <em>Greece</em>. He was not, as he himself asserted, critically handsome,
but eminently genteel. "Manners make the man," he was accustomed to
observe, "but the tailor, the gentleman: appearance is the premium where-with
you can discount society; it's gammon to talk about the aristocracy of
birth; why there's a second fiddle at Astley's that no Duke in the 'Red
Book' is fit to hold a candle to: <em>I</em> never had a grandfather, and is there any
mistake about <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p class='c000'>In this way of thinking, and a primrose satin waistcoat, Augustus proceeded
to essay the truth of his philosophy. A great poet has said, "All
the world's a stage;" had he added, "licensed only for the performance
of pantomime," the fancy would have well assorted with the fact. To
succeed in the drama of life the performer needs only activity—to keep
his eyes open, and his heart and his mouth shut. The two former of these
elements of success Kutitphat possessed; had the three been combined, he
might have become Lord Mayor. Though a denizen of Islington, inhabiting
a chamber which, had the house been another remove from town (at the
Antipodes), would have been the cellar—by grace of patent-leather Wellingtons
and a Polish tailor, he himself achieved a <em>polish</em> that not one in a
thousand would have known from the true metal. Even the ingenious youth
who, with a red coatee and nose to correspond, enacts the esquire at Crockford's,
looking after the coursers of the knights-errant who there do congregate—even
<em>he</em>, albeit as good an authority in such matters as the Lord
Chamberlain himself, was almost led into the indiscretion of a bow.
Augustus had just turned into St. James's Street, when our Cad-Crockfordian
caught sight of him. His right hand had all but reached the bit
of felt that did duty for the rim of his hat; but it fell ere the error was
irretrievable. "No," he soliloquized; "it ain't not qvite the ticket, but
unkimmin good at the price: blest if I warn't nearly had—<em>wont</em> he step
into <em>some</em> on 'em. At first, wouldn't I have pounded it he was a real swell;
but, now I twig him nearer, <em>his mother don't know as he's a taking of
the air</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Angelina Ampletin was one of the prettiest girls in Pimlico, and, if
there was any truth in rumour, very far from one of the worst <em>catches</em>.
Papa had retired from business at Billingsgate, with money enough to found
a dozen joint-stock banks, and leave a handsome surplus. In fact, <em>his</em>
turbot and salmon were all gold and silver fish! Now, as Augustus entered
the enclosure of the Park, Angelina and one of her friends were studying
ornithology on the margin of the stream that meanders between the Horse
Guards and Buckingham Palace. A glance of soul-speaking sympathy
passed between the youth and maiden—and, behold! the tiny hand of her
<em>Breguet</em> had not accomplished another revolution ere they were in confidential
communication. Let us not dwell on the progress of their loves;
day by day did they perambulate the sylvan shades of Kensington Gardens
(so called because destitute of both flower and fruit); and at length the
critical avowal was made—Angelina blushed her passion—"she lived only
for her Augustus; would he, indeed, fondly love on to the close?" History is
divided concerning the exact nature of his reply. According to one
account he is said to have declared that, if false, nothing should prevent
his being "jiggered;" while another asserts that, in evidence of immutability,
he called upon the zephyrs that sighed around them, then and there
to "blow him tight." Alas! for Augustus, that which the figure of his
form had built up, the figure of his rhetoric laid desolate. Angelina was
the soul of refinement and education, having been finished at Turnham
Green. With a look of horror she fled the presence of Kutitphat—that
<em>blow</em> was the unkindest <em>cut</em> of all!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was November, but still the weather was delicious. All the gay
things of nature were abroad; and even the wretched sought to borrow a ray
of the rich sunshine. Over the still verdant carpet of Hyde Park were
gliding graceful groups of fair women; while, among them, moved a form
that seemed to have little business there at such a time. Bless ye! dear
muffs and boas, no heresy is here intended, for instinct would curl the nose
of an angel in Eden who should chance upon a fellow in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</span></i> of an
ancient Taglioni, and no shirt. Was it a wonder, then, that Angelina gave
a wide berth to Augustus when she encountered him in such a category?
Where were now his airs and graces? All—all gone! The station, like
"the herald Mercury," exchanged for a posture between a faint and a sneak;
the glance of scorn, for the mien of supplication; the sheen of promise, for
the sear of despair! People speak of Brummel frying his own tripe as if
it were something to wonder at. Let them take a turn in St. James's
Park, any day between the first of January and the last of December, and,
unless they shut their eyes, they will discover more than one member of the
Kutitphat family at a discount.</p>

a body of pleasant-minded gentlemen, constituting a society bearing the
above name, who collect, with never-wearying application and research, the
various statistical reports connected with every subject of the day. Their
proceedings are duly chronicled in the different scientific and literary reviews,

<p class='c000'>Some valuable particulars have been gained in connection with the supper
taverns of London. Of every twenty visitors, it appears that eight order
Welsh rabbits, six ditto broiled kidneys, four ditto poached eggs, and two
ditto chops or steaks, as their taste may direct; and that these numbers are
divided into seven medical students, five lawyers' clerks, three gentlemen
from the country, the same number of men about town, and two shop-boys or
single tradesmen, who imagine they are so. Of these, more than one-third

<p class='c000'>As the affection of a child for its doll proverbially increases according to the
dilapidated state of the latter, the above tables afford an interesting view of
the probable existing proportion of nursery attachments at the present
moment. One child in three, at the Fair, had a mouth covered with gingerbread
crumbs, and five in twelve had the stomach-ache. The promenade
Concert d'Eté, which lasted all day long, embraced twenty-two penny trumpets,
or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cornets-à-bois</span></i>, nineteen musical fruits, six fiddles with packthread
strings, and four drums, varying in price from sixpence to two shillings. A
solo, by a very young performer, on a tin rattle filled with peas, was very
much admired.</p>

<p class='c000'>A paper, involving some singular points of manufacturing economy, has
been written, entitled, "What becomes of all the pins?" It appears, from
Professor Partington, that <em>twenty millions</em> of pins are daily manufactured in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>this country. These get into general circulation, and after a time, entirely
disappear; but the remarkable fact is, that, like the swallows, nobody knows
where they go to. It is proved that, were it possible to recall these lost
articles, a quantity might be collected sufficient to build the projected foot-bridge
at Hungerford Market, and the residue might be cast into one enormous
pin, which should be erected as a column in any part of London best
suited for its elevation, and to be called "Victoria's Pin," in opposition to
"Cleopatra's Needle," at Alexandria. There would be a winding staircase in
the interior, with a saloon in its head, and it might serve, not only as a land-mark
in stormy weather for the fourpenny steamboats plying between Vauxhall
and London Bridge, but, since the setting up of statues to everybody
that dies is getting into fashion, the column could be crowned with an image
of Shakspeare, Byron, or any other inferior character who has not yet been
so honoured, in London, beyond the lobbies of the theatres and Madame
Tussaud's.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the visiting report "On the Lunatic Asylums of the United Kingdom,"
we learn that the persons of unsound or slightly cracked intellects in
England, amount to ninety per cent., but that straight-waistcoats have gone
out of fashion, being superseded by straight pea-jackets with the majority
of the aberrated. Of a great quantity of lunatics now in Bedlam, five out
of thirteen are addicted to punching the crowns out of their hats, and then
putting them on topsy-turvy; and two in seventeen are not quite clear
whether they are the Secretary of State or Julius Cæsar, but collect small
pebbles, which they call petrified bears' heads and five-shilling pieces.
Ninety-one and a half per cent. believe they are perfectly sane, and that all
the rest are stark mad; whilst two in nine are preparing to bring an action
against the Queen for breach of promise of marriage. Of three hundred
wooden bowls allowed them for their gruel, twenty-four had been thrown at
the nurses and keepers in one day; and, in a single instance, one had been
converted into a species of cap, which was put on with much solemnity, and
the wearer then kept close watch in the yard for the whole week over a
strawberry-pottle, which he represented to be Windsor Castle. At Hanwell,
from the proximity of the asylum to the railway, twenty per cent. believe
that they are first-class carriages, and have a habit of whistling loudly when
they approach, that the others may get out of the way; a proceeding which
is generally advisable.</p>

<p class='c000'>A statement has also been made connected with the omnibuses of the
metropolis, from which it appears that, when you are waiting at the corner
of any street for an omnibus, seven out of eight are going the wrong way.
Ninety per cent. of the cads ask if you will ride outside when you hail
them; and, out of thirteen passengers, three wear kid gloves, eight sport
brown Berlin, and two none at all.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>REPORT OF THE CATNACH SOCIETY.</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Established a.d. 1841, on the Model of the Camden, Percy, and</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Shakspeare Societies.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<h5 class='c021'>RULES.</h5>

<p class='c016'>I.—The Society shall be called the Catnach Society.</p>

<p class='c000'>II.—The chief object of the Society shall be to reprint rare and unedited
ballads and handbills, printed, at various times, by Messrs. Catnach, Birt,
and Pitt, of Great St. Andrew Street, Seven Dials.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>III.—The Society shall consist of as many subscribers as can be got together,
and, as a precaution against bolting, the subscriptions shall be paid
in advance.</p>

<p class='c000'>IV.—A subscription of a guinea a year shall entitle the members to receive
a copy of all the works issued by the Society.</p>

<h5 class='c021'>BOOKS ALREADY PRINTED.</h5>

<p class='c016'>1.—<em>The Greenacre Garland; or, a Merrie Manual for Midnight Murderers</em>:
A collection of the most remarkable dying-speech bills issued within
the last forty years; comprising letters written, and hymns composed by
the malefactors the night before their executions, speeches on the scaffold,
copies of verses detailing the crime, and written for music, with views of
the execution, and occasional portraits of the felons. Edited by the late
Thomas Cheshire, Esq., of Newgate, Middlesex.</p>

<p class='c000'>2.—<em>A Collection of Political Songs and Ballads</em>, having reference to
some local particulars connected with a county election in 1833. As the
allusions in these relics are but imperfectly understood, and the interest
has quite gone by, this forms a valuable addition to the works already
published.</p>

<p class='c000'>3.—<em>The Street Anthology of the Nineteenth Century</em>; comprising notices
of the most popular itinerant musicians of the day: to which is added, an
inquiry into the probable author of "Jim along Josey;" with memoirs of the
following eminent perambulators—<em>viz.</em>, the little man in the soldier's coat,
with the "jolly nose," who indulges in <em>Billy Barlow</em> and <em>Follow the Drum</em>,
under a very diminutive and dilapidated umbrella, on certain evenings in
Leicester Square; the professional gentleman in the oil-skin cap, and
whiskers inclining to auburn, who sings to the dulcimer and attends the
races; the ambiguous character who ties his hair in bows, wears sandals,
carries a fan, and sings "She promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons,"
and dances to the chorus—"Tilly ung de rung tung de rung day," as he
plays an imaginary piano on his ribs; the two young gentlemen who black
their faces with soot and tallow, and sing "Sich a getting up stairs," standing
upon their heads, and dancing with their feet in the air; the conjuror
who wears a scarlet coat, does the doll trick, and tries to imitate "Jerry,"
but who does not succeed therein.</p>

<p class='c000'>4.—<em>Merrie England in the Modern Time; or, Richardson and his
Friends.</em> A singular collection of showbills and street advertisements,
edited by the late Mr. Richardson, of travelling-theatre celebrity; including
details of the various fairs he attended, and embracing endless anecdotes of
his contemporaries—the learned pig, black wild Indian, white Negress,
Scotch giant, fat boy, Welsh dwarf, young Saunders, Mr. Samivell, the
equestrian, &amp;c.; interspersed with many outlandish songs and recitations,
and dialogues between masters of shows and Mr. Merriman.</p>

<p class='c000'>5.—<em>Three Yards for a Penny.</em> A <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répertoire</span></i> of some reprinted popular
lyrical poems prevalent at the commencement of the reign of Queen Victoria;
including "Happy Land," "Claude du Val," "Woodman, spare that
Tree," "Nix my Dolly," "Wanted a Something," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>OH! LAW!</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>There never were such times as these! A barrister could once,
with ease, have got as many fees, by merely signing pleas, as would
have given him something more than bread and cheese; but destiny's
decrees have made it feasible no more to get such fees; and if the
lawyers please to live, they can no longer live by pleas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those days, alas! are flown, when seeds of litigation, shrewdly
sown, were very often known, not through a single life alone to have
thriven and grown, but to have reach'd the state that's call'd full
blown, in time for the attorney's son to make the crop his own. But
now the lawyers are thrown over—the system's overthrown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The common law is common now no more; full many a clause
in Acts of Parliament has clipped its claw. The time is o'er, when,
for an hour, one could jaw about the spelling of the man who did
the indictment draw, and whose mistake, or clerical <em>faux paw</em>, had
floored poor ill-used justice by a literal flaw.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Eldon now could rise and see the changes made since <em>he</em> would
doubt and disagree e'en with his own decree, what would the great
man's feelings be? He'd say this seems not like the Court of Chan<em>ceree</em>,
in whose old customs I had hoped that we had an estate in
fee; such suits as these would not have suited me!</p>

<p class='c000'>Oh! who would once have dared to dream that judges could have
worked by steam? Although, without a joke, justice would very
often end in smoke; and, from the speeches still preserved on paper,
we find that legal eloquence was often only vapour; while law itself
contained, as it would seem, the element and principle of steam; for
those who ever had a bout of it, found it hot water, and were very
glad when they got out of it. Mechanics' principles the lawyers
knew, and made amazing use of two—the wedge and screw! But
of the third, in early legal cases, there is little heard; for though to
scientific men of old the lever was well known, as we are told, the
lawyers seem to have refused it, or never used it. The lever they
despised; at least we find them not leaving anything they <em>could</em>
take behind them! But it is also thought some early barristers so
often moved in court, that they had something like a notion of
coming to perpetual motion.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>Doe on the demise of Roe, versus Roe on the demise of Doe.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This was a case of ejectment. Gabble (Q.C.) for plaintiff.—"This
is a clear case of ouster (<em>Shower</em>, 2); but if the tenant in possession
disputes the title of tenant in tail, he cannot plead <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laches</span></i> (<em>Campbell</em>,
1)." In this case the remainder man was regularly let in, but the
widow cannot now claim dower (<em>Blackstone</em>, 3). Suppose the mortgagee
had been anxious to foreclose, then plaintiff must have been
guided by the rule in Shelly's case (<em>Adolphus and Ellis</em>, 6.) Here
there is nothing of the kind. If defendant takes anything, it is in
the character of tenant in reversion after the possibility of issue
extinct (<em>Shower</em>, 1).</p>

<p class='c000'>Thumpus (Serjeant) <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">contra</span></i>.—Doe takes only a chattel interest,
or, at most, a base fee (<em>Taunton</em>, 6). The court must presume that
the outstanding term is satisfied (<em>East</em>, 6). The rule is not now as
Coke laid it down, for Mansfield (C. J.) declined taking it up. This
is a case of common ouster. Doe walked in as trustee, and was
kicked out in tail. There is no relief for him at common law
(<em>Bracton</em>). The door was shut upon him by defendant's son, and
the parent is not answerable for the act of the boy (<em>Chitty</em>). Judgment
was now delivered by the court.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mither (C.J.)—This is an uncommon case. Doe was never regularly
in, nor was Roe regularly out. Both took as devisees of the
same testator. The case in <em>Shower</em> cannot guide us here, though
the rule laid down has been recognised. I do not think there is
much in the objection to the widow's claim of dower, though I see
I have got it upon my notes. A mortgagee may suffer by <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laches</span></i>,
but then the defendant should have pleaded the <em>tort</em>. There is
nothing of this on the record, and the verdict must go accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Puny (J.)—I am of the same opinion. My brother Thumpus has
referred us to Bracton. I know the point in Bracton, and have decided
it twice the other way. But here I think the rule in Shelly's
case comes in and carries the verdict.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twaddle (J.)—There are four points in this case; three of them
amounted to nothing, and the fourth has been conceded. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laches</span></i>
ought to have appeared on the pleadings. There cannot be a use
upon a use (<em>Sanders</em>), but a trustee may take by the common law,
which the statute, Jac. II., c. 14, did not interfere with. The provisions
of the act removed much abuse, and the eighty-fourth is a
particularly wholesome section. Here these questions do not arise,
and, as the rule is clear, the verdict must follow it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shiver (J.)—I am of the same opinion.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE CHARTER.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c021'>A COMMONS SCENE IN THE YEAR 1843.</h4>

<p class='c016'>Several Members took the oaths, and the Speaker took his seat,
when six-and-twenty members all at once were on their feet. The
standing order then to move some dozen did begin; and, in compliance
with it, the Speaker ordered in, for all the honourable
members, each "a go" of gin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The worthy representative of Monmouth Street began to bring
before the house his well-digested plan, for making up the <em>deficit</em>, by
taxing every man who should be found to own a baked potato-can.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went into the history of <em>taturs</em>, from the day when first the
sun of science shone with resplendent ray, and pointed out for
baking them the most delicious way: he traced the rise of cans
from the very first of all, when they used to manufacture them particularly
small, until the later era, when they made them very tall,
with half-a-dozen lanterns, from which the light would fall, the
notice of the populace unto the can to call, and, like a very basilisk,
the little boys enthral.</p>

<p class='c000'>The member then for Battersea, in an impressive speech, brought
on his promised motion for giving Chelsea Reach, and also Twickenham
Meadows, another member each. He said, and while he said
it, he acknowledged it was true, that those who lived at Battersea
and Twickenham were few, but unto them the suffrage undoubtedly
was due, because it had been given to Hammersmith and Kew.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great election compromise was then at length discussed, and
it was soon decided that the sitting member must, upon a charge
of bribery, from out his seat be thrust; because he had corrupted,
with a pot of beer, a crust, and bit of cheese, a voter who took away
the dust.</p>

<p class='c000'>The watercress and radish trade presented a petition, complaining
very bitterly of their distressed condition, and praying that
the Parliament would put a prohibition on foreign cress and radishes,
which caused a competition that threatened to annihilate at once
the home vendition. The House, in tongues as numerous as e'er
were heard at Babel, expressed at once a wish to do whatever it was
able, and ordered the petition, then, to lie upon the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now the long discussion was eagerly resumed, upon the
knotty question, whether those who wern't illumed with a knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>of the reading art, could ever be presumed fit persons unto
whom the nation's guidance should be doomed? 'Twas argued
very cleverly, and was by all confessed, that, as the members had
not been by property oppressed, enabling them to sympathize much
more with the distressed, and, as they were with very slight qualifications
blessed, perhaps, if they had none at all, it would be for
the best.</p>

<p class='c000'>The House was now impatient, and many rose to say, that they
had listened long enough, and wished to get away; for they had
sat sufficient time to constitute a day, and therefore hoped the
Speaker no longer would delay, in ordering to each of them their
ordinary pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this the feeling of the House appeared to coincide; the
Speaker to the treasurer for funds at once applied, and at the
sight of money there arose, from every side, one universal clamour
of—"Divide! divide! divide!"</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>A CHARTER PARTY.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The United Female Chartist Washerwomen met a deputation from the Infant
Society of Universal Suffrage and Vote by Ballot Orphans, in the long room of
the Institution belonging to the former, when a discussion ensued on the subject of
the Charter.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at length resolved to extend the five <em>pints</em> to six; and it was finally
agreed that three quarts should constitute the measure they are jointly going for.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon a proposition that they should adopt the principle of the whole hog, a discussion
arose as to whether the gammon was to be included; but it was soon
decided that the whole hoggites would be nothing at all, if it were not for the
gammon, which was accordingly retained by a large majority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following subscriptions, in aid of the "Victim Fund," were then read by
the secretary, who stated that the amounts were in the hands of the treasurer
who was absent from indisposition:</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>It is a fact that Mr. Graball has resigned his very lucrative
situation, and that he thus relinquishes a thousand a year—<em>but</em>
he has received another appointment with a salary of fifteen
hundred.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that Mr. Skinflint put half-a-crown into the plate at
the last charity sermon—<em>but</em> it was a bad one.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that the once dissipated and extravagant Mr. Meltall
remained at home every evening last week—<em>but</em> he had no money
to go out with.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that the improvident and faithless Mr. Squander took
up a bill for ten pounds—<em>but</em> he gave one for twenty on the previous
day, in order to accomplish the object.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that the master of one of the Union Workhouses shed
a tear—<em>but</em> he was standing near the cook who was scraping horse-radish.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that Mr. Overhead can place his hand upon his heart,
and declare he does not owe a shilling in the world—<em>but</em> he has just
taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that Lord Stingy patronised the performances at
Covent Garden Theatre twice last season—<em>but</em> he went with an
order on each occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that the benevolent Mr. Bountiful gave his watch and
purse to a miserable object on Hounslow Heath—<em>but</em> he perceived
a stout bludgeon peeping from beneath the rags of the mendicant.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that the coffer-dam of the Hungerford Suspension
Bridge was drained completely dry—<em>but</em> it was full of water a week
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that Oxford Street is at last paved with wood—<em>but</em>
the alteration has caused much annoyance to the heads of the
parish.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that the Society for the protection of life against fire
were on the spot with their apparatus—<em>but</em> it was two days after
the conflagration had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that Mr. Feeling <em>expresses</em> great sympathy for the
poor—<em>but</em> he was never known to <em>feel</em> in his pocket for their relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that some of the low-priced bakers give full weight—<em>but</em>
they are very liberal of alum.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>MARCH WINDS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Meteorological Society held their great meeting on Waterloo
Bridge, to watch the nature of the March winds, and several very
interesting phenomena were made manifest. A member having
placed himself in one of the recesses, waited the coming of a gust
from the north, and was presently in a position to relate the following
particulars.</p>

<p class='c000'>His first sensation was that of a severe blow in the face, which
drew moisture from both his eyes, and sent out his hair into a
number of almost horizontal lines, some of them forming right
angles with his forehead. On turning his back, for the purpose of
further experiments, his hat underwent such rapid rarefaction, that,
becoming considerably lighter than the air, it was carried, in a
slanting direction, a few inches from his head, when the expansive
power of the atmosphere having ceased to take full effect, the gossamer
fell by its own specific gravity to the earth, and revolved on
its own axis as far as the toll-gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>A most interesting experiment was then tried with an ordinary
umbrella, upon which, in its closed state, the March wind was found
to have no particular power, though it was ascertained that there
was an equal atmospheric pressure on every part of the gingham.
On putting the umbrella up, and presenting it to the wind, the
holder of the machine was carried gently backwards, but on his
turning round, the sight became very animating to the bystanders.
The umbrella was completely turned inside out, and, at length, the
whole concern collapsed with a frightful crash—the points to which
the gingham was fastened being compressed together in a reverse
position to that which they were intended to occupy. The iron
rods attached to the whalebone immediately fell into angular
figures, and it was not thought advisable to proceed further with
the experiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was proved, beyond the possibility of doubt, that if the human
eye be kept wide open in a March wind, the dust will be carried
upwards until it reaches the organ of vision. This was experienced
in two or three cases; and an enthusiast in the cause repeated the
experiment several times, when it was found to fail in no single
instance.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE BRITISH MUSEUM TWO HUNDRED<br /> YEARS HENCE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The British Association for the Advancement of Science, which began its
meetings at Bristol, has since been strongly recommended to go to Bath; and
if it is not sent permanently to Coventry before the year 2043, we may
conceive its having reached by that time a state of stagnancy in the neighbourhood
of Bloomsbury. As there will, of course, be antiquarians among
them, imagination can easily picture them clinging fondly to St. Giles's, as
the quarter inhabited by the Anglo-Greeks; and the members will, no doubt,
be searching, a hundred years hence, for the fossil remains of petrified crows
in the neighbourhood of the Rookery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is an anticipatory report of the meeting of the Association,
after having been cradled in the laps of time during the lapse of a couple of
centuries.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE, APRIL 1, 2043.</h4>

<p class='c016'>Your Committee have the satisfaction to state that, their funds being
thoroughly exhausted, they have been enabled to save the usual expense of
travelling, and have taken advantage of the liberality of the Government for
the purpose of visiting the British Museum. Your Committee remained some
time at the outer gate, for the purpose of making some observations on two
boxes, which it is understood have been there for sentries; but, as they have
not discovered what a sentry is, your Committee conclude that the word
must be a corruption of centuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>On going through the court-yard the Association made some experiments
upon the atmosphere, with the view of calculating the difference (by means
of the differential calculus) between the air inside the gates and that which
circulates on the outside; but your Committee are unable to state any satisfactory
result to their arduous experiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>On entering the hall of the Museum your Committee have to complain of
being deprived of their walking-sticks; but this annoyance was in some
degree compensated by their receiving in exchange some very curious pieces
of tin, which are, no doubt, of very ancient origin. They were at once referred
to the chairman of the mineralogical section, who pronounced them to be the
coin generally in use in the nineteenth century, for the word tin is frequently
met with, in old books, where money is clearly the article alluded to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon reaching the great room your Committee were met by an officer of
the Museum, who conducted them over the building, and pointed out to your
Committee the chief objects of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Association had the satisfaction of looking at a very ancient machine,
called the stocks, which served the double purpose of punishing offenders and
regulating the money market. The chairman of your Committee was
appointed to sit on the stocks, and did so for a considerable time, in the
course of which he fully ascertained how they might have been available for
punishment, but he is still at a loss to discover the monetary uses which our
ancestors evidently put them to. It must be regarded as one of the lost arts,
like chuck-farthing, and other mysteries, which are now only left to us in the
pages of history.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your Committee were greatly delighted by a series of portraits of a tribe of
individuals, carrying <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">flagelli</span></i>, or whips, and whose noses were made the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>of a very learned paper by your president. The extreme redness of the point
was formerly supposed to arise from drinking brandy; but your president
having taken several successive draughts of that spirit, without any peculiar
redness in the nose becoming immediately obvious, was prevented by exhaustion,
ending in utter prostration, from continuing his very ingenious and
interesting experiment. It is believed, by your Committee, that the redness
of nose, which was characteristic of the old <em>auriga</em>, or coach-driver, arose
from a constant habit of blushing, which the peculiar modesty of the race, as
it is found alluded to in reports of police cases in past ages, would account
for easily.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the great attraction to your Committee consisted in the two celebrated
figures of antiquity, known to the public as the Whig and Tory, by whom,
according to old writers, this country was torn for a considerable period.
Your committee congratulate themselves that they do not live in those
shocking times, when, according to contemporary writers, the Whigs ruined
the British Constitution four times in six years, and the Tories gave, in the
same period, eleven death-blows to public liberty. How the Constitution
ever was restored to health, or how liberty was brought to life, has greatly
puzzled your Committee; but they have at last discovered that there were,
in those days certains pills which eradicated everything; and, as mention is
made in old books of various pillars of the state, your Committee have no
hesitation in attributing the wondrous cures to the means alluded to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your Committee had almost forgotten to mention a very curious old
machine, called a drop; and, taken in connexion with the black-letter phrase
of "a drop too much," there can be no doubt that the drop now in the
Museum was that which is constantly spoken of as "too much," by the old
chroniclers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remains of a gibbet also gave rise to a curious discussion in one of
the sections, and your Committee at last decided that the instrument was
used by a hanging committee attached to a society of painters, who, under
the pretext of executing justice, were in the habit of resorting to all sorts of
cruelty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Association were likewise favoured with the perusal of a very scarce
old volume, mysteriously labelled, "A tax-gatherer's Book;" from which
your Committee are led to infer, that there were formerly a class of marauders
who traversed the kingdom, going from door to door, and exacting sums of
money from the inhabitants. To show the frivolous pretexts that sufficed for
these plunderers to carry on their system of rapine, your Committee have
only to observe that a demand was made on account of light and air, which
were actually in those days paid for by the people in the form of what was
called a window-tax.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your Committee having concluded their inspection of the British Museum,
returned into the open air; and a shower of rain coming on, they had an
opportunity of making a series of observations on the effect which moisture
produces upon the skin, and the power of the animal caloric, in the human
foot, to resist for a time the chill ultimately engendered by walking into
puddles.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>REPORT ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH..</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Commissioners for inquiring into the state of the public
health have forwarded to each of their assistants a copy of the
following questions, with instructions to put them to all persons
residing in, visiting, or passing through the district:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How are you?</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the first and most obvious inquiry that the Commissioners
ordered to be addressed to the population; but, as the
returns were by no means so full as could be desired, it was determined
to add another question, which should distinguish those
cases in which disease has been inherited. For this purpose it was
arranged that a second, or supplementary question should be framed,
and the Commissioners drew up the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How is your mother?</p>

<p class='c000'>To both these questions the Commissioners have received numerous
replies, most of them short and concise; but it has been
observed that considerable soreness has been exhibited in some
cases, in which it has been thought advisable to ask for information
under the second head. The habits, or, perhaps, the Commissioners
ought rather to say, the prejudices of the English people are averse
to any investigation into their domestic affairs; and many, when
the health of their mothers has been inquired into, have manifested
a spirit that the Commissioners have found very detrimental to the
success of their efforts.</p>

<p class='c000'>It occurred to the Commissioners that the chemists' shops in
poor neighbourhoods would supply a vast mass of statistical information
on the subject of the public health, and they have ordered
a return of all the prescriptions made up within the last year,
classing them under the two heads of cathartic and stimulant.
The Commissioners have also ordered a schedule to be drawn up of
all medicine-bottles purchased at the rag-shops, and have instructed
their assistants to drain the contents of those which were not quite
empty, for the purpose of ascertaining their properties, with a view
to classing them under the heads already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been clearly ascertained that, in nine cases of acute tooth-ache,
in a very low neighbourhood, six "had it out," one applied a
leech to the gum, and two did nothing. In a series of ninety-four
cases of cough, it has been calculated that four ounces of Spanish
liquorice were consumed, while about one moiety of the patients
very patiently waited to see what time would do for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commissioners observe, with regret, that the ordinary sneeze
has been lately prevalent, but it does not appear that any safe mode
of treatment has yet been discovered for checking it. The Commissioners
think it better to trust to nature in such a matter, though
they have known the operation of drawing the finger smartly along
the bridge of the nose, towards the forehead, sometimes successfully
resorted to.</p>

nutshel. If I'd a been one of the unattached, it would not have signeyfied,
but the War Office is nothing but stone, as anybody may see, who looks at
it with half a high, and the Horse Guards is, by natur, as illumered as the
illumernatured clock at the top of it. But never mind; though Guvament
sends my legs on a march that lasts from Jannivary to Deesember, my art
can stay in the deepot of your affexions. Yes, there, without the aid o'
barracks, it is reglarly barrackaded. But I spose you'd like me to tell yer
something about Chainy and the Chainees. Well, yew no the plates called
the villa pattern, with three fellers on a bridge, looking as if they vus a goin
fishin—the vun vith a boatook, tother vith a deal board, and the thurd vith
a cricket ball tied to the hend uv a walkin stik. Nou, I dare say yew think
that's a korrect drawin of Chainees men and manner; but, spoonies as they
are, I never seed 'em makin such preshious hasses of themselves, as they are
in all the plates yure muther has of 'em. Then the tree with the horanges,
is only to puff off the real Chainy, as they sells for two a penny in the streets;
bekause if they vus only half as big as the hartist has made 'em they'd be
whoppers indeed, and the Chainees karacter is rayther the other way; for
they're always whopt themselves, instead of being whoppers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ven I new I vus a goin to Chainy, I took a number of Chambers; I don't
meen that I highered a sweet of rooms, but I bort the Hinformation for the
Peeple, treatin (as they calls it, though one has to pay for the treat) of
Chainy. Akordin to the book, I find that the natives call Chainy the middle
country, and it really is among the middlins, for everything about it is werry
indifferent. The Great Wall runs so far that one can't say where it goes to,
vich is exakly the way with the troops, though it's ony in the long run that
they are anything like the wall, for they don't behave at all like bricks in any
other partickler. A good deal has been said about the sighs of the Grate
Wall of Chainy, and won says won thing, and won another; so that I've come
to the konklusion that it's just as broad as it's long, and that settles it. One
side of the place is bounded by the Pacific; and I spose it's bathing in the
Pacific that makes the natives fight so preshusly shy of fightin. I hunderstand
the hurth used to be a good deal given to hurthquaking; but the
ground has given up that game, and the quakin bisness is now dun by the
military, who are no great shakes after all, xsept in that rispect.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natives say that Chainy is older than the deluge, but this must be a
delugion. At hall events it's not much like a place of the furst vater. I
think they make a mistake about the time when the flood happened, for they
were overrun by a tremendous great Khan, who plunged them into hot water,
and poured the cream of the Tartar troops all over them. This made such a
heffervescence as never was; and as all the provinces was swamped, it's like
enuff they mistook the bursting out of this great Khan for the reglar deluge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hemperor is called the Brother of the Moon; and I shouldn't wunder
if he's related in sum way, for I think he's crack'd, which is a common
thing enuff in Chainy. They say he's the father of his peeple, and the
mother two but I don't see how they make both of 'em aparent. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Guvament robs the natives vith vun hand, and pitches into 'em vith the
other; so that betwixt being bamboozled and bambooed, they get a nice
time of it. They used to be werry klever in science, but they're losing
their hearts like winking; and though they don't paint particklarly good
picters, they're great dabs at colours. Indeed, dying is the only thing they
seems to excel in, as the returns of their killed will prove, to anybody's
satisfakshun. As to ourselves, I've very little noose—hardly enuff to hang
a line upon. Of korse you hurd of the affair at the Bogue, and the pretty
Tilt we had with 'em! but it was such a farce, that I thought of sending
the report to Messrs. <em>Tilt</em> and <em>Bogue</em>, for their Comic Allmyknack. The
knavy of the poor fellers is quite stationary, which means to say that it's
little better than brown paper; and as to their artillery, I don't believe their
gunpowder would be strong enuff to shake the nerves of an old washerwoman.
The soldiers all of 'em ware tails, and seem to be wery proud on
'em, for they always turn 'em to us direktly they cum into akshun. Poor
Lin, who was to be the grate card, has turned out anything but a trump;
and I shouldn't wonder if he gets cut at last by a chop from the Hemperor.
The Chainees are werry proud of their feet, which I don't wunder at, considerin
that, in battle, they owe so much to 'em. The wumen's shoes are
so small that it hinterferes with rithmetic, and makes a foot only three or
four inches. It only shows how cramped they are in their hunderstandings.
I've urd it said that, sum day or anuther, the Chainees will adopt our abbits.
Only fancy the Hemperor in a coat down to his eels, and knee britches,
vitch, they say, will ewentually be the long and the short of it. As to our
fashonable kustoms, they'd easy enuff fall into them, for I've seen 'em dance
at a ball in the most natral manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I must konklude; for a Chainee regiment of 600 is cummin on, and
I'm ordered to relieve guard, with my six men, a quarter of an hour before
the time, so as to kill two burds with wun stone, by changing the sentries
and frightnin away the henemy.—Your dewoted</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE COMPLETION OF THE TUNNEL.</h3>

<p class='c016'>This stupendous work is finished, and Wapping has reason to be proud of
such a truly wapping undertaking. Perhaps no enterprise ever had so much
cold water thrown upon it, and never was there a project which it seemed at
one time so difficult to go through with. The engineer has worked like a
horse, and has scarcely ever been out of the shaft.</p>

<p class='c000'>The original shareholders, whose pockets were well drained, in fruitless
efforts to drain the tunnel, have now the satisfaction of once more running
through their property. For some time the ardour of the projectors was
damped by the works going on rather too swimmingly. When accidents
were every-day occurrences the Tunnel was a matter of interest; but since
the water has been effectually kept out, it has become a dry subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>On more than one occasion the Company would have been swamped, in
spite of all hands being put to the pumps, if Government had not lent their
sucker. The funds, in fact, were at low-water mark long before the works
reached the same desirable point; and the more the Tunnel was set afloat
the more were the shareholders aground in their undertaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the perils are now past, and the Tunnel remains as a monument to
British enterprise. We should call it, perhaps, a pillar to the fame of the
engineer, if it were not that a pillar is incomplete without two things, one
of which—the shaft—has been taken away, while the proprietors have long
since lost sight of the capital.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>REMARKS ON THE WEATHER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps the best method of ascertaining the fact of its being warm or
cold is to go out into the air; but if you are unable to do this, and a person
coming in from out of doors is seen to rub his hands, you may presume that
the atmosphere is chilly.</p>

<p class='c000'>An infallible method of ascertaining whether it is wet is to watch the
puddles in the streets, and if you see them agitated you may conclude that
rain is descending.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there has been a frost at night you may look for ice in the morning,
and, in winter, if you have no thermometer, you may get some valuable
information from the state of your pitcher.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rattling of tiles overhead indicates wind; and a descent of soot down
your chimney foretells rainy weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>The approach of winter may generally be prognosticated by a general
display of Chesterfield Wrappers, at the doors of cheap tailors' shops; but
when 25,000 straw bonnets are seen in linendrapers' windows, spring may be
confidently looked forward to.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the water-carts are particularly active you may expect rain; and if
a flash of lightning is visible, prepare for thunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you see the advertisement of a flower-show, it would be prudent to
provide yourself on the day named with an umbrella.</p>

<p class='c000'>If your water has not come into your cistern, you may conclude there has
been frost, unless you happen to be in arrear with your rates, when the
phenomenon may be otherwise accounted for.</p>

    <div><em>Letter from a Passenger on Board the Submarine Steamer.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Well, here we are, safe and sound at the bottom of the Bay of Biscay,
where we intend to sleep one night, for the purpose of testing the qualities
of the bed of the ocean, which consists, as you will suppose, of several sheets
of water, and plenty of wet blankets, with billows instead of pillows on the
top of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not being able to keep my head above water I determined on making a
bold plunge, and therefore took my passage in the submarine steamer, where
several others, who were, like myself, over head and ears, were anxious to
keep out of the way, and having sunk all my available capital, I thought it
better to sink myself by way of looking after it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have had a very delightful voyage, but we met on our way with some
very odd fish, who stared rather rudely in at our cabin windows, and a party
of lobsters looked exceedingly black as we passed very near to them. The
mermaids were much alarmed at first, but soon became reconciled to our
appearance, and, when we talked of weighing our anchor, they, with much
simplicity, offered us the use of their scales.</p>

<p class='c000'>You are aware that a company is forming for the purpose of turning the
tide of emigration towards the bottom of the sea; and if people can live under
water, they ought not, from mere motives of pride, to be above it. There will,
of course, be some difficulty in dealing with the natives, but we have taken
the precaution to treat with an influential oyster, who, however, keeps extremely
close, and, if he will not manifest a little more openness, it is expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>that war to the knife must be resorted to. We at first anticipated some
hostility from the sharks, but, as we purposely abstained from bringing any
lawyers among the first settlers, we have now very little fear of a collision on
account of conflicting interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appearance of our vessel has caused a considerable sensation among
the inhabitants of the ocean, but we have followed the plan of the early
emigrants to strange parts, and endeavoured to propitiate the various fish
by trifling presents. We threw a box of antibilious pills to a large party of
Cockles, and we pitched overboard a quantity of false collars to a group of
salmon, whose gills seemed sadly out of condition. We also distributed
copies of Crabbe and Shelley to as many of the crustaceous fish as approached
near enough to our vessel to enable us to do so; while to a dog-fish we presented
a fine specimen of bark, which he did not appear very much to relish.
We met on our way down with one of the white sharks, which are known to
be the terror of mariners. The creature stared at us with both its eyes, and,
while we maintained an awful silence, the shark seemed to respond to our
muteness by holding its jaw in the most alarming manner: the extended
cavity of its frightful mouth presented a harrowing exhibition, and it seemed
as if, like other exhibitions, it might be "open from ten to four," and then it
would have been ten to one if we had escaped from being drawn into it.
The tremendous teeth seemed clearly to indicate that there would be "no
admittance except on business," and we at length sheered off from sheer
timidity.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we can only manage to get up a colony down here, there will be plenty
of patronage at our disposal; and if we are allowed the appointment of a
bishop, where can there be a finer see than that which is here open to him?
I have already issued prospectuses of a grand <em>Oceanic Agricultural Association</em>,
to be established for the purpose of regularly ploughing the deep, and
dividing the proceeds among the shareholders. I state, in my advertisement,
that, as we know the sea has produced sea-weed, we may reasonably expect
that other vegetable matter may be reared, and as irrigation is the chief
expense of agriculture, the saving in the article of water alone must keep
the thing afloat—to say nothing of what will naturally flow into the coffers
of the company.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must now conclude my letter, for the vessel is about to start; and, as
"tide and time wait for no man," you will perceive that I am so far tied to
time as to be unable to add more than that I am</p>

<h3 class='c007'>EFFECTS OF THE INCOME-TAX.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Everybody is beginning to draw in to meet the necessity for pulling out.
Tradesmen are reducing their expenses in all directions, and a respectable
grocer has just dismissed an assistant who suited him to a T. A cook-shop
boy, who used to be kept purposely to carry out the provisions to the customers,
has been sent away, in order to enable the proprietor to carry out the provisions
of the income tax. A large linendrapery house in the Westminster Road has
cut off "a young man," who is thus thrown, as it were, as a burden on the rest
of the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>Individuals in a respectable sphere of life, who could formerly keep a page,
have been obliged to turn over a new leaf; and it is a positive fact that a
Conservative peer intends, in the ensuing Session, putting down a Brougham.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is not only among old and established interests that the burden will
be felt, for it is ascertained beyond doubt that the boys will be alarming sufferers.
The toffey dealers have already commenced manufacturing an inferior
article, which is being palmed off upon the juveniles as the genuine Everton.
We have personally analysed a piece of Albert rock, under the new system,
and we have discovered an increased proportion of sand in its composition.
It is also a lamentable fact that a baked potato man has stopped up—we hope
not permanently—one of the chimneys of his apparatus, besides extinguishing
one of the fine lanterns with which it is adorned—a piece of retrenchment
that will fall first on the oilman, and ultimately on the whale-fishing interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>An influential publican has shockingly reduced his only potboy, and the
unhappy lad is walking about the streets on a salary four <em>per cent.</em> under that
of last year—a miserable victim to the income-tax, and a martyr (of course) to
Tory ascendancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Respectable families, who never before considered the matter worth a thought,
are looking narrowly to the candle-ends, giving, it is true, a momentary impulse
to the trade in save-alls, but the flush is feverish, and will, of course, be followed
by depression. The perquisites thus lost, by a stoppage in the kitchen-stuff
commerce, can only be made up by the servants taking it out of their
masters' bones, which used formerly to be abandoned to the grubbers, who
must in future look for grub in some other direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The penny-a-liners have also been lowered, in order to enable some of the
newspaper proprietors to pay the income-tax, but it is expected this reduction
will be counterbalanced by the increase in the number of cases of real distress,
and the other raw articles which form the staple of paragraphs.</p>

with the oyster-shells. They are not so liable to be attacked by
the grubs, and the cats do not displace them so readily by running

<p>Show of Hands for a Liberal Candidate.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>SHOW OF HANDS FOR A LIBERAL CANDIDATE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The borough is in commotion; the public spirit of the place, which is cold
without excitement, has become warm with; and every one, with the understanding
of an infant, is in arms for one or the other of the candidates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bill-stickers are beginning to stick up for the different parties to the
approaching contest, and a linendraper has cut his principles to ribbons by
selling his favours to both sides. The Liberal candidate has just come into the
town, and has taken an oath that he will not spend a shilling in the contest;
so that, unless his agents understand business better than he does, his return
to Parliament is out of the question; but his return to the place from whence
he came would be the wisest step possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tory candidate has taken another course, and all the voters in his interest
are reeling drunk about the streets, prepared to fight, or in fact to do
anything but to stand up for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nomination took place yesterday, when the show of hands was decidedly
in favour of the Liberal; but, on the Tory being proposed, there was an extensive
show of cabbage-stalks, one of which was transplanted into the eye of the
honourable candidate. Most of the hands that were held up had something
upon the nail; and it is generally rumoured that all the ten-pounders were
loaded to the muzzle, at a dinner given by a committee-man from London, on
the popular side, who ran away with the money entrusted to him to pay the
bill, rather than damage the good cause by letting in a proof of agency. He
preferred, like a true patriot, letting in the landlord.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Corn Laws are, of course, the subject of much difference of opinion;
and one of the candidates is in favour of a sliding scale, while the other declares
that skates are the only things that ought to come in upon it. He expressed
also his conviction that we have no less an authority than that of Lord Nelson
for resisting, and even for evading the fixed duty; "for," he exclaimed, "were
not these the last words of the gallant hero—'England expects every man to do
his duty'?—which is equivalent to a strong recommendation to every man 'to
do' the authorities who collect the duty at the custom-house."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Income Tax has caused an immense sensation in the borough, and the
blind beggar who stands at the corner of the street, who evidently sees the
matter in its true light, is indignant at having to expose the amount of his
earnings. He says it is an immoral law, for it places a tax on the offerings of
benevolence; but he admits that the Tariff offers him some equivalent, by letting
in timber at a lower rate, and giving buoyancy to the trade in lucifers.
Many declare they do not know what their income is, and on being told they
must find it out, reply that they certainly cannot find it at home; while others,
when called on for a return of what they have made, ask for a return of what
they have lost, a query by which the assessor is generally much mystified.
Moore and Murphy have sent back their papers without filling them up, but in
answer to the demand for an account of their last year's profits, have sent
copies of their respective almanacks, in every line of which "no prophets" is
glaringly written.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Our Liberal candidate speaks very plainly on the subject, and declares that
he would rather see his constituents without any incomes at all, than that they
should be liable to the odious measure. His views on the Tariff are of the
same bold and startling character. He denounces the Government for letting
in more asses, and plainly tells the electors that they ought to stand up for
themselves, and assert the sufficiency of native asses for all reasonable
purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tory has been trying the old game of kissing the children, and chatting
with the wives, but the independent electors are not to be gammoned in this
manner, as they formerly used to be. He nursed Mrs. Snooks's twins for half
an hour yesterday, and having had them so long in his arms, he, of course,
spoke the truth when he said he knew what it must be to have a young family
on one's hands, and how very glad the parents must be to get them off as soon
as possible. He has also bought cats enough, at ten pounds a head, to stock
an island the size of St. Kitts; but ten to one if the voters come to the scratch
after all, and if they do there will be the clause in the new act that will be sure
to catch hold of him. The election will proceed to-morrow, and arrangements
have been made with an extensive rubbish carter to bring up the out-voters,
who are expected to prove regular out-and-outers in favour of the Liberal. The
Tory is compelled to resort to the truck system, on account of his opponent
having taken all the other modes of conveyance, and there is no doubt that a
vehicle for party purposes will be made of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hustings have just come to the earth with a frightful crash, the scaffolding
having given way just as a poll was being loudly demanded. The confusion
was, of course, dreadful. An unbending Whig fell on to the bald head of a
Tory; and a stickler for the "five points," which are always in his mouth, received
between his teeth the end of a walking-stick. A free-trader, who
expresses openly his antipathy to anything in the shape of protection, was
fortunately saved by a plank falling in a slanting direction over him; and a
well-known participator in the late strike got a severe blow on both arms,
which must keep the hands unemployed for a long period. The rival candidates
are being looked for among the rubbish, and a man is at work with a
spade, so that it may be supposed then situation is somewhat <em>infra dig.</em> at
present. Both must have received a few plumpers, and the state of their
respective polls must be rather unsatisfactory.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In Dover jail two actors were locked up to wait for bail:</div>

      <div class='line in4'>For, out of empty boxes,</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Upon their absence of attraction,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>His actors did begin to twit,</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>INFANT EDUCATION.<br /> BABY-LONIAN UNIVERSITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The grand aim of modern infant education is to make learning
very attractive; to invest Lindley Murray with a magnetic power
over the pupil's mind, and dress Dilworth in an adhesive plaster
that shall cause all the little boys in the kingdom to stick to it. If
Mavor's Spelling can be converted into a magic spell, there is a hope
that the infant population may be charmed into an appreciation of
<em>ba</em>, <em>be</em>, <em>bi</em>, <em>bo</em>, <em>bu</em>; and such will be the progress of education that we
may have, before the expiration of a century, universities at which
the wet nurse and the professor may be alike required to attend
to the physical and intellectual wants of the infant students. A
Bachelor of Arts will not only be entitled to the distinction of B.A.,
but may add the letters B.Y. to complete his description. It has
already been suggested that philosophy should be taught by toys,
and it will be easy to give a lecture on the laws of motion, illustrated
by a game at marbles, or to explain the theory of equations by reference
to the pleasing pastime of nine-pins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pons Asinorum</span></i>, that has puzzled many of our modern youth,
will be much more easily overcome when a real donkey-ride is
resorted to; and the difficult process of looking for the square root
will be greatly facilitated by a spade, when the student finds himself
sent forth to dig in the garden of science.</p>

<p class='c000'>Already has the worthy Mr. Wilderspin introduced, in many
places, the agreeable system of making fun of school; and if he
would only consent to put his infant pupils into the fantastical caps
and gowns which are worn at the universities, the joke would be
still richer than it is at present. "To that complexion we shall
come at last;" and if education is to be made game of, the sooner
we go "the whole hog," the better.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is an extract from a report that is intended to illustrate
the enormous success of the Wilderspin system:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Teacher.</em> What is this I hold in my hand?</p>

<h3 class='c007'>INDIAN RUBBER.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Society for washing the physical blackamoor morally white,
and altering the complexion of Indian society, has sent out 1000
copies of "Major A. on Short Whist," in the hope that a friendly
rubber may do more towards rubbing off the rust of barbarism than
any other hitherto-attempted experiment. It is thought by the
Society in question that, as among Europeans those who are called
blacklegs generally succeed best at cards, the niggers, who have the
advantage of being black all over, may compete successfully with
the most accomplished member of Crockford's. The reports on the
subject are not yet very encouraging, for though there can be but
one odd trick in the course of a single deal, the Indian disciples of
Major A. perform a series of the very oddest tricks all through the
game; and when their instructor endeavoured to make them understand,
by signs, that clubs were led, they followed suit in good
earnest, and began scoring away at a tremendous rate with their
tomahawks. It is feared that the idea of teaching the blacks by
the card must be discarded. The only game for which they show a
natural inclination is cribbage, at which their hands are always
excellent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the observations and notes of the emissaries sent out by
the Society, we find it recorded, as a curious fact in natural history,
that, though perfectly black in the hand, the Indians have all the
characteristics of the light-fingered population of this country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is thought impossible to wean the natives at once from the
eccentric habit of scalping; but it has been ingeniously suggested
that the propensity may be directed to proper objects, and it is in
contemplation to put pots of porter before one of the tribes, when,
if they proceed as usual to decapitation, leaving nothing but the
headless beer, it will not at all signify.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>This fine old force is still upon a peace footing, and the Government
has refused new regimentals to any of the men, who are
nearly all grown too corpulent to wear their old ones. The coat of
the colour-sergeant of the Lancashire Lights has been pieced in
the back, and is now made to meet in front; and a false hem
having been made to his regulation ducks, he is enabled, by the aid
of very lengthy straps, to wear the uniform of the regiment. The
band has dwindled to a solitary drum, and, as the War Office will
not allow of any augmentation, the adjutant, who plays a little on
the flute, takes a part on public occasions, when the staff is expected
to attend muster.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is now a field day once in six months, when the regiment,
which consists of seven superannuated sergeants and one private, go
through a sham fight; and on the last occasion they carried the
pound by a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</span></i>, in spite of the beautiful manœuvring of
the adjutant, who personated the garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the recent strike in the North the militia's instructions
were to act as a reserve, and they followed the recommendation to
the letter, for such was their modesty that they were not to be
drawn out from their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépôt</span></i> on any pretext whatever. The thanks
of the city were afterwards presented to the adjutant in a congreve
box, and he received an autograph letter from the mayor, speaking
strongly of the forbearance that the militia had exhibited.</p>

<p class='c000'>25th.—A holiday at the Law Courts. Nothing doing, and nobody done.</p>

<p class='c000'>31st.—The King of Prussia visited Newgate in the morning, and Drury
Lane Theatre at night. His Majesty saw murderers at both places, and
admired the new drop at each.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>FEBRUARY.</h4>

<p class='c016'>3rd.—The Queen opened Parliament in person with a speech from the
throne, showing her readiness at all time to put in her spoke for the common
wheel.</p>

shillings a quarter objected to by a county member, on the ground that it
would amount to thirty-two shillings a year.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>MARCH.</h4>

<p class='c016'>11th.—Sir R. Peel made his financial statement, and declared his intention
of increasing the duty on whisky; an announcement that had not the effect
of raising Irish spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>16th.—The day fixed for the earthquake that was to have broken London
into little bits. It, however, broke nothing but its appointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>18th.—The Queen and Prince Albert having visited Drury Lane Theatre,
the house was full, and the royal pair gave an audience to the manager.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>APRIL.</h4>

<p class='c016'>4th.—The House of Commons resolved itself into a Committee of Ways
and Means, when Sir R. Peel's ways of getting means were much objected to.</p>

<p class='c000'>18th.—Discussion in the House of Lords on the New Corn Bill, when the
Duke of Buckingham plainly intimated that the Premier deserved to be turned
out, for having taken others in.</p>

<p class='c000'>22nd.—A dispute between Mr. Lumley and Signor Mario, when the latter
complained of hoarseness, and the former declared that <em>he also</em> was taken by
the throat.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>MAY.</h4>

<p class='c016'>2nd.—Presentation of the Chartist's petition. Its weight made a deep
impression on the floor of the House, but none at all on the members.</p>

<p class='c000'>12th.—The Queen's Ball Masque. Several old ladies endeavoured to conceal
their years by appearing in the costumes of the middle age.</p>

performed the judicial office so well that two things were tried at once—the
cause before him and his own patience.</p>

<p class='c000'>23rd.—Execution of the murderer Good. A good riddance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of this month the Whigs charged the Tories with the greatest
assurance in having taken up the former's policy.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>JUNE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>3rd.—Continuance of the sugar duties moved by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
He contended that though the tax was little in separate pounds of
moist it amounted to a great deal in the lump.</p>

<p class='c000'>4th.—Proclamation issued on the subject of certain sovereigns discovered
to be light. The new regulation not to affect India, where the natives princes
are all of a dark complexion.</p>

to adopt the fashion of trains.</p>

the adjournment of the House, and bring the Premier to a stand by perpetual
motion.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>JULY.</h4>

hurry to go off.</p>

<p class='c000'>3rd.—Attempt of the varlet Bean on the life of Her Majesty. It appeared
that the little deformity was given to sentiment, and that the hump on his
back weighed heavily on his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>7th.—Mr. Hume moved for a Return of the actual services of all flag
officers, which was refused from a fear that many of them would turn out to be
much below the standard. He was denied similar information respecting

had never been in any action except as defendants.</p>

was much <em>under-eighted</em>.</p>

New Houses of Parliament, objecting to the site of the building, and the sight
of money required for completing it.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>AUGUST.</h4>

<p class='c016'>1st.—Miss A. Kemble married to a count, and will, it is to be hoped, find
her account in the step taken.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>'Tis a pity Miss Kemble retires so soon,</div>
      <div class='line'>When money she makes to so pretty a tune.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>5th.—Prince Albert shot ninety-six rabbits in the royal preserves. The
animals, anxious for the honour of seeing the Prince, fell the unhappy victims
of a too fatal curiosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>6th.—A gentleman having received a newspaper sealed with the motto,
"Time flies," was charged full postage on account of "information" contained
on the wrapper.</p>

<p class='c000'>14th.—Gooseberries, apples, and pears selling for a mere nothing in Covent
Garden Market, being, as the growers declared, the fruits of the Tariff.</p>

<p class='c000'>25th.—Trial of the vagabond Bean, who was found to be one of a very
inferior kidney.</p>

Provost was out of bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>2nd.—A return presented to Parliament of the condition of the inmates of
Greenwich Hospital, when it was found that there were thirty-six pensioners
who had only the right leg left.</p>

<p class='c000'>3rd.—Covent Garden Theatre was advertised to open, but Miss Adelaide
Kemble was too hoarse to sing; and though her father had so much at stake
in the theatre, it was found that his daughter had no voice at all in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>6th.—Mr. Carter bitten severely in the thumb by one of his lions. The
animal was recently purchased and not used to his master, who was trying a
few tricks merely to get his hand in.</p>

<p class='c000'>12th.—An investigation into the Dover cropping case. The jailor, finding
he was not to cut the hair of the prisoners, cut his own stick, and resigned
his situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>21st.—A calculation made, that the shelves of the King's Library at Paris
extend to twenty miles—a proof of what extraordinary lengths some writers
will go to.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>OCTOBER.</h4>

<p class='c016'>1st.—It was generally suggested that banking-houses should close at four,
because the system of shutting at five (after which hour there is still much
to be done) has the effect of driving their business very often to sixes and
sevens.</p>

<p class='c000'>12th.—Miss Briers and Mary Ann Morgan brought to Union Hall on a
charge of having conspired to lead Mr. Woolley into another union against
his will. Mr. Woolley, though evidently on thorns, and regularly caught by
the Briers, declared his intention not to prosecute; he, however, commenced
a suit for divorce against Mary, in reference to whom he refused to be
<em>Molly-fied</em>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
